Box 740256 Atlanta, GA 30348 www.equifax.com 1-888-397-3742 P.O. Box 4500, Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com 1-800-916-8800 P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016 www.transunion.com  The following information reflects recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection.  Free Credit Report.

You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.  To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228.  You can also order your annual free credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFTC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

You must contact each of the credit reporting agencies directly to obtain such additional report(s).  Medical Privacy.  We recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statements that you receive from your insurer.  If you see any service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your insurer at the number on the statement.  If you do not receive regular explanation of benefits statements, contact your provider and request them to send such statements following the provision of services in your name or number.

Pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, you may place a fraud alert on your file free of charge.  For Colorado and Illinois residents: You may obtain additional information from the credit reporting agencies and the FTC about fraud alerts.  Security Freeze.

It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.

The fee is waived if you are a victim of identity theft and have submitted a valid investigative or law enforcement report or complaint relating to the identity theft incident to the credit reporting agencies.
