(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPharmaca\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), 4940 Pearl East Circle, Suite \\n301 Boulder, CO 80301, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the \\nsecurity  of  personal  information  relating  to  Washington  residents.    The  number  of  affected \\nWashington residents is unknown.  By providing this notice, Pharmaca does not waive any rights \\nor defenses regarding the applicability of Washington law, the applicability of the Washington \\ndata event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction. \\nBackground \\n\\nAfter receiving reports of fraud related to a small number of customers from payment card issuers, \\nPharmaca began an investigation, and on or around December 6, 2018, identified suspicious code \\non its point-of-sale systems.  Pharmaca immediately began working with leading security experts \\nto help determine what happened. Through this investigation, Pharmaca confirmed, on or about \\nDecember  19,  2018,  that  malicious  code  may  have  captured  customer  credit  and  debit  card \\ninformation used for purchases at certain Pharmaca stores between July 19, 2018 and December \\n12, 2018.   Since that time, Pharmaca has continued working with its payment card processor to \\nidentify potentially impacted cards, and continued its investigation to confirm the scope of the \\nincident.  Payment card information, such as credit or debit card number, expiration date, and other \\ncard data, may have been acquired. Names may also have been captured for customers making \\nswipe transactions, which represents a small portion of total cards used.   \\n\\nMullen.law \\n\\n\\x0cOffice of the Attorney General \\nJanuary 18, 2019 \\nPage 2 \\n\\nNotice to Washington Residents \\n\\nIt  cannot  be  confirmed  which  cards  used  during  the  window  of  compromise  were  actually \\nacquired.
