(\xe2\x80\x9cCPT\xe2\x80\x9d) understands the importance of protecting the information it maintains. Regrettably, \nwe write to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved your personal information, which was provided to \nCPT in connection with the <<CaseName>> class action settlement. This notice explains the incident, measures we\nhave taken, and some steps you can take in response.\n\nCPT is a class action settlement administrator. We send settlement notices to class members, answer questions \nclass members may have, and processes settlement  payments. To accomplish this function, we are provided with \nnecessary data about class members, including certain types of personal information. The underlying class action was \ndismissed and is no longer active.\n\nOn February 8, 2018, CPT learned through its ongoing forensics investigation of a phishing email incident that \ncertain emails and attachments could have potentially been accessed by an unauthorized person. The investigation, \nconducted with the assistance of a computer forensics firm, determined that an unknown individual had access to a \nCPT employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account from November 22, 2017 through December 8, 2017. While some of the attachments \nwere encrypted and/or password protected spreadsheets, CPT could not rule out the possibility that the spreadsheet \npasswords may have also been available to the attacker. Although, to date, we do not know that any of your sensitive \npersonal information was accessed without permission, we are providing you this notification out of an abundance of \ncaution. The information that could have been accessed in the affected employee\xe2\x80\x99s account includes former class \nmember names, addresses, and Social Security numbers.\n\nWe are notifying you so that you can take appropriate steps to protect yourself and to offer you a complimentary \none-year membership to Kroll Identity Monitoring. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team \nhas extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. Your \nidentity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration. For more\ninformation on identity theft prevention and Kroll Identity Monitoring, including instructions on how to activate your \ncomplimentary one-year membership, please visit the below website. \nVisit my.idmonitoringservice.com to activate and take advantage of your identity monitoring services. \nYou have until July 26, 2018 to activate your identity monitoring services.\nMembership Number: <<MontoringCode>>\n\nWe sincerely regret that this incident occurred. In addition to providing you notice of the incident, CPT has \ntaken  substantial  steps  to  enhance  its  existing  network  and  email  security,  including  implementing  multi-factor \nauthentication, and is re-educating and training its employees to help prevent a similar incident from happening in the \nfuture. \n\nIf you have questions about this incident or the recommended next steps, please toll-free 1-833-219-9086 \n\nMonday through Friday between 8:00 am and 5:30 pm Pacific Time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJulie Green\nSenior V.P. of Operations\n\n\x0cCPT Group, Inc. \n\n\x0c\x0cMORE INFORMATION ON WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF\n\nEven if you decline to take advantage of this complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft prevention service, we remind you \nto remain vigilant for incidents of  fraud or identity theft by reviewing  your account statements and free credit reports for any \nunauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three \nnationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll \nfree at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows: \n\nExperian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742\nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800\nEquifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of identity theft, or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should \nimmediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office in your state. You can obtain information \nfrom these sources about steps you can take to avoid identity theft, as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. \nYou should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case \nyou are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as \nfollows:\n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft\n\nYou may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened \nin your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent \npotential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and \nother third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit \nfreeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit \nfreeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, \ngenerally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.   Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on \nyour credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, \nplease contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.\nTo place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major reporting agencies by\nregular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below:\n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com\nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com\n\nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:\n\n1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)\n2. Social Security number\n3. Date of birth\n4.\n\nIf you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five \nyears\n\n5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill\n6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military\n\nidentification, etc.)\nIf you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to \na law enforcement agency concerning identity theft\n\n7.\n\nThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit \nreport. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique \npersonal identification number\n(\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the\nsecurity freeze.\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must call or send a written \nrequest to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and \nthe PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or \nindividuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The\ncredit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to lift the security freeze for those identified\nentities or for the specified period of time.\n\nTo remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail and include proper \n\n\x0cidentification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the \nsecurity freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business days after receiving your request to remove the security freeze.\n\n\x0c""",Delaware

A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting \nagencies  from  releasing  your  credit  report  or  any  information  from  it  without  your  express  authorization.  You \nmay place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three nationwide \ncredit  reporting  companies.

Call 1-877-322-8228  or  request  your  free  credit  reports  online  at  \nwww.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any \naccounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If \nyou have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.\n5. \nEven if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \nrecommends that you check your credit reports periodically.

Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many \ncreditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint \nwith the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), \nor  by  mail  at  Federal  Trade  Commission,  Consumer  Response  Center,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW,  \nWashington, DC 20580.

A fraud alert helps \nprotect against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a credit grantor \nchecks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the credit grantor gets a notice that the applicant may be the \nvictim of identity theft. The alert notifies the credit grantor to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can \nplace a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free fraud numbers provided below. You will reach \nan automated telephone system that allows flagging of your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.\nEquifax \n \nExperian \n \nTransUnion \n \n\nP.O.

If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your \ncredit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain \ncredit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a security freeze. \n\nSecurity freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a security freeze \nalso varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must \nseparately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit bureau. To place a security freeze on your credit \nreport you need to send a request to a consumer reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular \nstamped mail. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are \nrequesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with \nmiddle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous \naddresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency \nor the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card \nand a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your \nname and current mailing address, and the date of issue. \n\nP.O.

You may submit a declaration of removal to remove information placed in your \ncredit report as a result of being a victim of identity theft. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit \nreport or submit a declaration of removal pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act. \n\nThe security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report \nwithout your express authorization or approval. \n\nThe security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your \nconsent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, you will be provided with a personal identification \nnumber, password or similar device to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily \nauthorize the release of your credit report to a specific party or parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze \nis in place. To remove the freeze or to provide authorization for the temporary release of your credit report, you must \ncontact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following: \n(1) the unique personal identification number, password or similar device provided by the consumer reporting agency; \n(2) proper identification to verify your identity; \n(3) information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report or the period of time for which \nthe credit report may be released to users of the credit report; and \n(4) payment of a fee, if applicable. \n\nA consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze on a credit report \nshall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.

You should plan ahead and \nlift a freeze, either completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, with enough advance \nnotice before you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect. You should contact a consumer reporting agency \nand request it to lift the freeze at least three business days before applying. As of September 1, 2008, if you contact \na consumer reporting agency by a secure electronic method or by telephone, the consumer reporting agency should \nlift the freeze within fifteen minutes. You have a right to bring a civil action against a consumer reporting agency that \nviolates your rights under the \xe2\x80\x9cFair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nFor Residents of North Carolina\n\nYou may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the North Carolina Attorney \nGeneral\xe2\x80\x99s Office:\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, Consumer Protection Division, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC \n27699-9001, 1-877-5-NO-SCAM, www.ncdoj.gov\n\nFor Residents of Oregon\n\nState laws advise you to report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement, as well as the Federal Trade \nCommission.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing \nyour account statements, explanation of benefits, and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity \nand  to  detect  errors.  Under  U.S.  law,  you  are  entitled  to  one  free  credit  report  annually  from  each  of  the  three \nmajor credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free,  \n1-877-322-8228.  You  may  also  contact  the  three  major  credit  bureaus  directly  to  request  a  free  copy  of  your  \ncredit report.\nFraud Alerts. At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts \ncreditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit \nwhile the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified \nto place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding \nyour credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:\nEquifax\nP.O. Box 105069 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n1-800-525-6285\nwww.equifax.com\n\nTransUnion\nP.O. Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19016 \n1-800-680-7289\nwww.transunion.com\n\nExperian\nP.O. Box 2002 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n1-888-397-3742\nwww.experian.com\n\nSecurity Freeze. You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit \nbureau from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. \nHowever, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent \nthe  timely  approval  of  any  requests  you  make  for  new  loans,  credit  mortgages,  employment,  housing,  or  other \nservices. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee \nto place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will \nneed to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

(\xe2\x80\x9cAnimoto\xe2\x80\x9d) located at 333 Kearny Street 6th Floor, San Francisco, CA  94108, \nand are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information \nrelating  to  8,842  Delaware  residents.  By  providing  this  notice,  Animoto  does  not  waive  any  rights  or \ndefenses  regarding  the  applicability  of  Delaware  law,  the  applicability  of  the  Delaware  data  event \nnotification statute, or personal jurisdiction. \n\nNature of the Data Event \n\nOn  August  6,  2018,  Animoto  confirmed  that suspicious  activity  on  its  system  may  have  resulted  in the \nunauthorized acquisition of user data, including dates of birth, geolocation, hashed and salted passwords, \nand usernames (user email addresses).  While the passwords were salted and hashed (a process that obscures \nthe password), it is unknown whether the salt key was acquired.  \n\nAnimoto first learned of suspicious activity on July 10, 2018, when it received an alert of unusual activity \non  its  system.    Upon  review,  Animoto  identified  queries  being  run  against  its  user  database.    Animoto \nimmediately stopped the queries and launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party experts.  \nOn August 6, 2018, Animoto\xe2\x80\x99s investigation confirmed the queries were unauthorized and that user data \nmay have been obtained on or around July 10, 2018.  While Animoto cannot confirm that data was removed \nfrom its systems or that any particular user information was affected, Animoto is advising its users about \nthis incident out of an abundance of caution. The information that was accessed may have included first \nname, last name, username (email address), hashed and salted passwords, geolocation, gender, and date of \nbirth.  Complete payment card data is stored in a separate system that was not accessed.  \n\nNotice to Delaware Residents \n\nOn or about August 16, 2018, Animoto began providing rolling  notice of this incident to all potentially \nimpacted  individuals.    Animoto  does  not  keep  address  information  for  most  users,  and  does  not  have \ngeolocation information for all users.  Animoto has approximately 985 users whose addresses are located \nin Delaware, and 7,857 users who geolocate to  Delaware. Please note geolocation information does not \nmean Animoto can confirm state of residency.  Notice is being provided by email in substantially the same \nform as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.   \n\nOther Steps Taken and To Be Taken \n\nUpon discovering the event, Animoto moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the \nsecurity  of  Animoto  systems,  and  notify  potentially  affected  individuals.    Animoto  is  also  working  to \nimplement additional safeguards. Animoto changed employee passwords and is urging all users to change \ntheir passwords immediately.  In addition to working with experts to conduct an investigation, Animoto \nreplaced system passwords and reduced the number of users who could access certain systems.  Animoto \ncontinues  to  monitor  for  suspicious  activity  and  make  enhancements  with  their  systems  to  detect  and \nprevent unauthorized access to user information including rebuilding infrastructure to make it more secure.  \nFurther, Animoto is examining ways to enhance overall network cyber threat detection technology and has \nreported this incident to law enforcement. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cEXHIBIT A \n\n\x0c\x0c'",Delaware

This \nnotice is to inform you that some Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen restaurants have been the \nvictims of cyberattacks, which may have resulted in unauthorized access to or \nacquisition of your payment card information. Below you will find more information \nabout the incident and the steps we are taking, as well as the steps you can take, to help \nprotect you and minimize the risk of your payment card information being misused.   \n \nWhat Happened \n \nOn August 16, 2018, Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen (a concept acquired by Darden \nRestaurants in 2017) learned that between November 3, 2017 and January 2, 2018, an \nunauthorized person or persons gained access to the Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen network \nand were able to access and potentially obtain payment card information used to make \npurchases in certain Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen restaurants in the following states: \nAlabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, \nMaryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.   \n \nOnce Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen learned of this incident, we engaged a third-party \ncybersecurity firm to investigate. Our current systems and networks were not impacted \nby this incident. The unauthorized access appears to have occurred on a network that \nwas permanently disabled and replaced by April 10, 2018. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that \nthere are no indications of unauthorized access to the current Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen \nnetwork and systems. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved \n \nWhile the investigation continues, our current understanding is that the affected \npersonal information involved payment card information, including payment card \nnumbers. \n \nWhat We Are Doing \n \nWe take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. As noted, \nthis incident occurred on a network that was permanently disabled and replaced by \nApril 10, 2018. As an added precaution, we have arranged to have ID Experts\xc2\xae provide \nidentity protection services at no cost to those individuals who may have been affected \nby the incident. To enroll for the services, please call (888) 258-7280 by November 22, \n2018. ID Experts is offering the following services: MyIDCare services include 12 months \nof credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and \nfully managed identity theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help \nyou resolve issues if your identity is compromised. \n\n  \n\n\x0c \nWhat You Can Do \n \nEnroll in the identity protection services we are providing. Even if you choose not to \nenroll, we recommend that you remain vigilant and take steps to protect yourself from \nidentity theft by reviewing your account statements and by checking your credit report \nfrom one or more of the national credit reporting agencies periodically. You are entitled \nto obtain a free annual credit report from each of the nationwide credit reporting \ncompanies\xe2\x80\x94Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To do so, please go to \nwww.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. If you notice any suspicious \nactivity, you should promptly report such activity to the proper law enforcement \nagencies. \n \nWe also recommend that you consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files. Adding a \nfraud alert to your credit report file makes it more difficult for someone to get credit in \nyour name by requiring creditors to follow certain procedures. However, this may also \ndelay your ability to obtain credit. No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit \nreport except you, so if you elect to do so, contact one of the three nationwide credit \nreporting agencies. The first agency that processes your fraud alert will notify the others \nto do so as well. \n \nYou may also add a security freeze to your credit report file to prohibit a credit reporting \nagency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written \nauthorization. In some cases, agencies may charge a fee to place or remove such a \nfreeze. \n \nEquifax \nConsumer Fraud Division \nP.O.

We sincerely regret to inform you that, after completing a thorough forensics investigation, we \nhave reason to believe your personal data may have been compromised through the access or use by an unauthorized \nindividual. The unauthorized access resulted in the potential viewing or theft of the personal data of some customers \nthat purchased products on Tech Rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s web storefront, which is available online at www.TechRabbit.com.  The \npersonal data included credit card information. Tech Rabbit has taken the steps necessary to eliminate the threat to \nyour personal data and implement improvements to prevent such unauthorized access from happening again.  We \nare sending this letter to provide you more information about the incident and what you can do to remain vigilant \nand protect your information.   \n \nWhat Happened \n \nOn August 8, 2018, after an external forensics investigation conducted in accordance with our obligations under the \nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and in collaboration with our credit card processor and the major \ncredit card brands, Tech Rabbit confirmed an unauthorized individual gained access to the company\xe2\x80\x99s online \nproduct order system.  The intruder viewed or stole a subset of customer payment records for purchases made on the \nTech Rabbit website.  According to the forensics investigation, the unauthorized access was made possible through \nthe use of malicious software in a variety of attacks that took place between February 22, 2017, and May 22, 2018.    \n \n\nWhat Information Was Involved \n \nThe accessed systems contained the following personal information.   \n \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Payment information, including credit card numbers, security code and date of card expiration; \n\xef\x82\xb7  Customer first and last name;  \n\xef\x82\xb7  Customer mailing address;  \n\xef\x82\xb7  Customer email address; and \n\xef\x82\xb7  Customer telephone number. \n \n\nWe are not able to confirm, specifically, whether your personal data was viewed or removed from our systems as a \nresult of this incident. We only know that the viewing or removal of some customer data was possible or occurred \nbetween February 22, 2017 and May 22, 2018.  \n \nWhat We Did and What We Are Doing \n \nOnce aware of the threat to customer data, we promptly took steps to secure the system and identify the scope of the \nincident with the help of a contracted security firm and forensics investigator.  We have continued to implement the \nrecommendations from the security firm and continue to review and audit our practices to prevent this from \nhappening again. We have also coordinated our investigation and response to the incident with the credit card \nbrands, our credit card processor and applicable banks in accordance with Payment Card Industry Data Security \n\n \n\n1 \n\n\x0cStandards (PCI-DSS).  We have also provided notice of this incident to state authorities and credit reporting \nagencies as required under applicable state laws. \n \nWhat You Can Do \n \nWe highly recommend you review all credit card statements for activity on any credit cards you may have used on \nthe Tech Rabbit store website.

Some of Travel Leaders Group\xe2\x80\x99s customers\xe2\x80\x99 \npersonal and private information was subject to unauthorized access.   \n \nBased on Travel Leaders Group\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, some of your personal information was accessed by the \nperpetrator of the cyber-incident.

The third-party contractor failed \nto implement agreed-upon security protocols. \n \nWhat type of information was involved? \n \nThe personal and private information that the perpetrator gained access to included customers\xe2\x80\x99 names, \naddresses, and credit card information.  In some cases, the perpetrator also made changes in the \ncomputer system to steal customers\xe2\x80\x99 airline frequent flyer travel points and benefits from hotel and car \nrental loyalty programs.  Travel Leaders Group reported the security breach to the authorities and will \ncooperate with them to bring the perpetrator to justice.   \n \nYou are receiving this notification in compliance with Del.

A fraud alert \nhelps protect against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name.  When a credit \ngrantor checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the credit grantor gets a notice that the applicant \nmay be the victim of identity theft.  The alert notifies the credit grantor to take steps to verify the identity of the \napplicant.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free fraud numbers \nprovided below.  You will reach an automated telephone system that allows flagging of your file with a fraud alert \nat all three credit bureaus.\nEquifax\n\nwww.equifax.com\n\n800 -525-6285\n\nExperian\n\nTransUnion\n\nP.O.

A security \nfreeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you \nplace a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report \nunless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  \nAs of September 21, 2018, you have the right to request a credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency, free of \ncharge.   Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit bureau.  To \nplace a security freeze on your credit report you must contact the credit reporting agency by phone, mail, or secure \nelectronic means and provide proper identification of your identity. The following information must be included \nwhen requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information \nmust be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; \n(3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident \nreport or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include \na copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It \nis essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. \nBelow, please find relevant contact information for the three consumer reporting agencies: \nEquifax Security Freeze\n\nwww.equifax.com\n\n800-685-1111\n\nExperian Security Freeze\n\nTransUnion\n\n888-397-3742\n\nwww.experian.com\n\n800-909-8872\n\nwww.transunion.com\n\nOnce you have submitted your request, the credit reporting agency must place the security freeze no later than 1 \nbusiness day after receiving a request by phone or secure electronic means, and no later than 3 business days after \nreceiving a request by mail.
