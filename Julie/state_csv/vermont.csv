Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring \ncredit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of \nthe three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or \ncall 1-877-322-8228.

In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a \nconsequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop \nand reverse the damage quickly.  \n\nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. \n\n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after \nactivating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also \nvia Experian\xe2\x80\x99s or Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, \nbefore they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect \nyou, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows: \n\nCredit Bureaus  \n\nEquifax Fraud Reporting \n\n1-866-349-5191 \nP.O. Box 105069 \n\nAtlanta, GA 30348-5069 \nwww.alerts.equifax.com \n\nExperian Fraud Reporting \n\n1-888-397-3742 \nP.O. Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013 \nwww.experian.com \n\n \n\nTransUnion Fraud Reporting \n\n1-800-680-7289 \nP.O. Box 2000 \n\nChester, PA 19022-2000 \nwww.transunion.com \n\nIt is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three \nbureaus  confirms  your  fraud  alert,  the  others  are  notified  to  place  alerts  on  their  records  as  well.  You  will  receive \nconfirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An \ninitial fraud alert will last for one year. \n\nPlease Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you. \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n \n6.  Security  Freeze.  By  placing  a  security  freeze,  someone  who  fraudulently  acquires  your  personal  identifying \ninformation will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need \nto contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place \nthe freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift \nor permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files. \n \n7.

Our investigation indicates only \na small percentage of Welk\xe2\x80\x99s Owners were potentially affected by the incident.  \nWhat  Information  Was  Involved?

Pursuant to \nfederal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.  Should you wish to place \na security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:\n\nExperian\nP.O.

This letter contains information about steps you can \ntake to protect your  information and resources being made available to help you.\nWhat Happened? On January 30, 2019, we learned that we had been the victim of a ransomware attack that affected \nour patient records. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that is used by cybercriminals to encrypt or lock \nup files on computers or servers and demand a ransom payment in order to restore access to the locked information.  \nThis ransomware attack locked the server that stored some of our patient information.\nImmediately upon detecting the incident, we launched an investigation and engaged an independent forensics firm \nto assist in determining what happened and whether any individuals\xe2\x80\x99 protected health information (\xe2\x80\x9cPHI\xe2\x80\x9d) had been \naccessed or acquired without authorization.  While there is no evidence that any sensitive or personal information \nhas been misused, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution.\nWhat Information Was Involved? The information potentially involved may include patient names, addresses, and \nprescription information.  The impacted server did not and does not store patient Social Security numbers or credit \ncard information.\nWhat We Are Doing.  As soon as we learned about the incident, we took the steps described above.  In addition, we \nare providing you with information about steps you can take to help protect your information.  \nWhat You Can Do.  While  we  do  not  believe  any  patient  personal  information  was  at  risk,  you  can  follow  the \nrecommendations included with this letter to protect your personal information.  In addition, we are providing you \nwith  Automatic  Identity  Protection  that  includes  $25,000  of  identity  insurance  and  unlimited  access  to  Identity \nFraud, Inc. fraud resolution specialists to help resolve any type of identity theft or fraud.  \nFor  More  Information.

You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected \nincidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC).\nCopy of Credit Report:  You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit \nreporting  agencies  once  every  12  months  by  visiting  http://www.annualcreditreport.com,  calling  toll-free \n877-322-8228,  or  by  completing  an  Annual  Credit  Report  Request  Form  and  mailing  it  to  Annual \nCredit  Report  Request  Service,  P.O.

As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit.  You must \nseparately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency.  In order to place a security \nfreeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including \nyour full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued \nidentification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.  \nAdditional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from \nyour respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.

9,The Topps Company Inc. ,"b' \nThe Topps Company, Inc. \nOne Whitehall St. 5th  fl. New York, NY 10004-2109 \n\nTelephone: (212) 376-0300 \n\nFebruary 22, 2019 \n\nNOTICE OF DATA BREACH \n\nDear Topps Customer, \n\nThe  Topps  Company,  Inc.  (\xe2\x80\x9cTopps\xe2\x80\x9d)  understands  the  importance  of  protecting  the  personal \ninformation  of  our  customers,  and  we  are  therefore  writing  to  inform  you  that  certain  personal \ninformation you submitted through the www.topps.com website when making a purchase recently \nmay  have  been  compromised.    This  incident  may  have  affected  customers  who  completed  a \npurchase through the website between November 19, 2018 and January 9, 2019.  Topps has since \nupgraded  the  website  platform,  and  this  notice  does  not  apply  to  purchases  made  through  the \nwebsite after January 9, 2019.   Because you are potentially affected, we want to share with you \nwhat we know and steps you can take to help protect your personal information. \n\nWHAT HAPPENED? \n\nOn  December  26,  2018,  Topps  became  aware  of  possible  unauthorized  access  to  the \nwww.topps.com website.  We launched an investigation with the assistance of an external security \nfirm.  On January 10, 2019, following the investigation, we confirmed that there was unauthorized \naccess to the website, which may have resulted in access to or acquisition of payment card and \nother  information  that  customers  provided  when  placing  orders  through  the  website  between \nNovember  19,  2018  and  January  9,  2019.        While  we  cannot  confirm  whether  your  personal \ninformation was  accessed  or acquired, the investigation confirmed that  this was possible during \nthe relevant time period. \n\nWHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED? \n\nIt is possible that this incident compromised names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail \naddresses,  and  payment  information  (including  credit/  debit  number,  card  expiration  date,  and \nsecurity  code)  for  customers  who  completed  a  purchase  through  the  Topps  website  between \nNovember 19, 2018 and January 9, 2019.  Based on our investigation, we have no reason to believe \nthat information for customers who completed a purchase through PayPal was affected. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cWHAT WE ARE DOING \n\nOnce  we  became  aware  of  this  incident,  we  engaged  an  external  security  firm  to  examine  our \nnetwork.  We stopped the incident and worked with the security firm and our website development \ncompany  to  implement  measures  to  strengthen  the  security  of  our  systems  and  help  prevent  a \nsimilar  incident  from  happening  again.    We  have  since  upgraded  the www.topps.com website \nplatform. \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO \n\nWe recommend that you take steps to protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft.  First, \nyou  should  review  your  payment  card  statements  and  immediately  report  any  suspicious  or \nunauthorized activity to the issuer.  Second, we recommend that you contact the three major credit \nreporting agencies (\xe2\x80\x9cCRAs\xe2\x80\x9d) to place a fraud alert and/or security freeze on your credit file.  We \nhave enclosed with this letter contact information for the CRAs and additional information about \nfraud alerts and security freezes.  Please read it carefully, as there are differences between a fraud \nalert and security freeze. \n\nEven  if  you  do  not  find  any  suspicious  activity  on  your  initial  credit  reports,  the  Federal  Trade \nCommission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically.  Under federal \nlaw, you are entitled to a free credit report once per year from each of the CRAs.  Checking your \ncredit  reports  periodically  can  help  you  identify  problems  and  address  them quickly.   You  may \nvisit www.annualcreditreport.com, a website sponsored by the three CRAs, for more information \non how to request your credit report. \n\nIf  you  find  suspicious  activity  on  your  credit  reports  or  have  reason  to  believe  your  personal \ninformation is being misused, you should take two steps.  First, call local law enforcement and file \na police report.  Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve \nyou of the fraudulent debts.  Second, file a complaint with the FTC at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or 1- \n877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).  Your complaint will be added to the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s Identity Theft Data \nClearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.  For additional \ninformation, you can write to: FTC Consumer Response Center, Room 130-B, 600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue,  N.W.,  Washington,  D.C.,  20580.   Your  state\xe2\x80\x99s  Attorney  General  can  also  provide  you \nwith information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft. \n\nAdditional information for residents of Maryland, North Carolina, and Rhode Island is enclosed \nwith this letter.  This notification was not delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation. \n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION \n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us (1) by mail at One Whitehall Street, New \nYork, NY 10004, Attn: General Counsel, (2) by e-mail at contactus@topps.com, or (3) by phone \nat  800-489-9149,  Monday  through  Friday,  9  am  to  4  pm  ET.

Here is some information on how to request a fraud alert and ask for a credit \nfreeze, along with contact information for the three major national credit reporting agencies \n(\xe2\x80\x9cCRAs\xe2\x80\x9d), Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.  There are differences between how the CRAs \nhandle fraud alerts and security freezes, so please read this carefully. \n\nFraud Alert \n\nThere are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on \nnotice that you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that \nan initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to \nbe, a victim of identity theft.  An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year.  You \nmay have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of \nidentity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your \ncredit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any \none of the three national CRAs: \n\nEquifax \n1-800-685-1111 \nP.O.

Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19016 \nwww.transunion.com \n\nYou have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free \nof charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number \nthat is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.  If you place a security freeze, potential creditors \nand other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily \nlift the freeze.  Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. \n\nThere is no fee to place, lift, or remove a security freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must \nseparately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.  For \ninformation and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the CRAs at the addresses \nbelow: \n\nEquifax \nP.O.

Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.); \n2. Social Security Number; \n3. Date of birth; \n4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived \nover the prior five years; \n5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill; \n6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or ID \ncard, military identification, etc.) \n7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative \nreport, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft; \n8. If you are not a victim of identity theft, include payment by check, money order, or credit \ncard (Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through the \nmail. \n\nThe CRAs have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure \nelectronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security \nfreeze on your credit report.  They must also send written confirmation to you within five \nbusiness days and provide you with a unique PIN or password or both that can be used by you to \nauthorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit \nreport, or to lift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request \nthrough a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting \nagency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to the credit \nreporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security \nNumber) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze \nas well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report \nor the specific period of time you want the credit report available.  The credit reporting agencies \nhave one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for \nthose identified entities or for the specified period of time. \n\nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a \nsecure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request \nvia regular, certified, or overnight mail to each of the three credit bureaus and include proper \nidentification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password \nprovided to you when you placed the security freeze.  The credit bureaus have one business day \nafter receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business \ndays after receiving your request by mail, to remove the security freeze. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cAdditional Information for MD, NC, and RI Residents \n\nMaryland Residents: The Maryland Attorney General can provide you with information about \nthe  steps  you  can  take  to  avoid  identity  theft:  Consumer  Protection  Division,  Office  of  the \nAttorney  General,  200  St.  Paul  Place,  Baltimore,  MD  21202,  Toll-free:  1-888-743-0023, \nidtheft@oag.state.md.us. \n\nNorth  Carolina  Residents:  The  North  Carolina  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  Consumer \nProtection Unit can provide you with information about the steps you can take to avoid identity \ntheft: Consumer Protection Division, NC Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, \nRaleigh, NC 27699-9001, Toll Free: (877) 566-7226, http://www.ncdoj.gov/. \n\nRhode Island Residents: The Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General Consumer \nProtection Unit can provide you with information about the steps you can take to avoid identity \ntheft: RI Office of the Attorney General, 150 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02903, Phone: \n(401) 274-4400, E-mail: contactus@riag.ri.gov, \nhttp://www.riag.ri.gov/ConsumerProtection/About.php. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\x0c'",https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2019/02/21/the-topps-company-inc-notice-of-data-breach-to-consumers/,Vermont

We take the security of your information very seriously and \nsincerely apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause. This letter contains information about what \noccurred and steps we can collectively take to protect your information.\n\nWhat Happened and What Information Was Involved\n\nOn January 9, 2019, we became aware that an employee was accessing archived customer order forms for \norders placed prior to July 28, 2016. We immediately suspended the employee\xe2\x80\x99s employment and commenced an \ninvestigation to determine the extent of unauthorized access. We also contacted the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office where the access \noccurred and took steps to identify anyone affected by this incident.\n\nOur investigation determined that the employee attempted to use six (6) credit cards to make online purchases. We \nimmediately terminated the employee\xe2\x80\x99s employment and disabled the account used to access the customer order \nforms. While we could not confirm whether the employee accessed all customer order forms, out of an abundance of \ncaution, we are notifying all individuals whose information was in the account for orders placed prior to July 28, 2016. \nThe orders forms that may have been accessed listed your name, address, and credit card information.\n\nWhat We Are Doing\n\nWe take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. We want to assure you that we have taken steps \nto prevent a similar event from occurring again. Prior to this incident, we had changed our procedures to encrypt all \npayment card information submitted with customer orders.

Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name, Social \nSecurity number, date of birth, or other identifying information, without authority, to commit fraud. For \nexample, someone may have committed identity theft by using your personal information to open a credit \ncard \nvisit \nwww.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street \nN.W., Washington, DC 20552. \n\ninformation, \n\nFor  more \n\naccount \n\nname. \n\nyour \n\nloan \n\nget \n\nor \n\nin \n\na \n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you specific rights when you are, or believe that you are, the \nvictim of identity theft. Here is a brief summary of the rights designed to help you recover from identity \ntheft. \n\n1.  \nYou have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting agencies place ""fraud alerts"" in your \nfile to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft. A fraud alert can \nmake it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain \nprocedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in \nyour file by calling just one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. As soon as that agency \nprocesses your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your file. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEquifax: 1-800-685-1111; www.equifax.com  \nExperian: 1-888-397-3742; www.experian.com  \nTransUnion: 1-800-888-4213; www.transunion.com  \n\n\x0cAn initial fraud alert stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert stays in your file for seven \nyears. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate \nproof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended alert, \nyou will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you \nhave filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer \nreporting  agency  may  require  you  to  submit.  For  more  detailed  information  about  the  identity  theft \nreport, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. \n\n2.\nYou have the right to free copies of the information in your file (your ""file disclosure""). An initial \nfraud  alert  entitles  you  to  a  copy  of  all  the  information  in  your  file  at  each  of  the  three  nationwide \nagencies, and an extended alert entitles you to two free file disclosures in a 12-month period following \nthe placing of the alert. These additional disclosures may help you detect signs of fraud, for example, \nwhether fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name or whether someone has reported a change \nin your address. Once a year, you also have the right to a free copy of the information in your file at any \nconsumer reporting agency, if you believe it has inaccurate information due to fraud, such as identity \ntheft. You also have the ability to obtain additional free file disclosures under other provisions of the FCRA. \nSee: www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.  \n\n3.\nYou have the right to obtain documents relating to fraudulent transactions made or accounts \nopened using your personal information. A creditor or other business must give you copies of applications \nand other business records relating to transactions and accounts that resulted from the theft of your \nidentity, if you ask for them in writing. A business may ask you for proof of your identity, a police report, \nand an affidavit before giving you the documents. It may also specify an address for you to send your \nrequest. Under certain circumstances, a business can refuse to provide you with these documents. See. \nwww.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.  \n\n4.\nYou have the right to obtain information from a debt collector. If you ask, a debt collector must \nprovide you with certain information about the debt you believe was incurred in your name by an identity \nthief - like the name of the creditor and the amount of the debt. \n\n5.\nIf you believe information in your file results from identity theft, you have the right to ask that a \nconsumer reporting agency block that information from your file. An identity thief may run up bills in your \nname and not pay them. Information about the unpaid bills may appear on your consumer report. Should \nyou  decide  to  ask  a  consumer  reporting  agency  to  block  the  reporting of  this information,  you must \nidentify the information to block, and provide the consumer reporting agency with proof of your identity \nand a copy of your identity theft report. The consumer reporting agency can refuse or cancel your request \nfor a block if, for example, you don\'t provide the necessary documentation, or where the block results \nfrom an error or a material misrepresentation of fact made by you. If the agency declines or rescinds the \nblock, it must notify you. Once a debt resulting from identity theft has been blocked, a person or business \nwith notice of the block may not sell, transfer, or place the debt for collection. \n\n6.\nYou also may prevent businesses from reporting information about you to consumer reporting \nagencies if you believe the information is a result of identity theft. To do so, you must send your request \nto the address specified by the business that reports the information to the consumer reporting agency. \nThe business will expect you to identify what information you do not want reported and to provide an \nidentity theft report.  \n\n\x0clearn  more  about \n\nTo \nits  consequences,  visit \nwww.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore, or write to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You may \nhave additional rights under state law. For more information, contact your local consumer protection \nagency or your state Attorney General. \n\ntheft  and  how \n\nto  deal  with \n\nidentity \n\nIn addition to the new rights and procedures to help consumers deal with the effects of identity theft, the \nFCRA  has  many  other  important  consumer  protections.  They  are  described  in  more  detail  at \nwww.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.  \n\nAdditional Steps You Can Take to Protect Against Identity Theft \n\nWe encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account \nstatements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity.  Under U.S. law you are entitled to \none free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.  To order your free \ncredit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228.  You may also contact \nthe three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report. \n\nYou  have  the  right to place a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer \nreporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization.  The \nsecurity  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  credit,  loans,  and  services  from  being  approved  in  your  name \nwithout your consent.  However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over \nwho gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, \nor prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, \ncredit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.  Pursuant to federal law, you \ncannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.  Should you wish to place a \nsecurity freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below: \n\nExperian\nPO Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n1-888-397-3742 \nwww.experian.com/freeze/center.\nhtml \n\nTransUnion\nP.O.

Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.); \n2. Social Security number; \n3. Date of birth; \n4.\n\nIf you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the \nprior five years; \n\n5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill; \n6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or ID card, \n\nmilitary identification, etc.);  \nIf you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, \nor complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft. \n\n7.\n\n\x0cAs an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on \nyour file at no cost.  An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit file.  Upon \nseeing a fraud alert display on a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the \nconsumer\xe2\x80\x99s identity before extending new credit.  If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to \nan extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below.\nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert.  You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.  An initial \nfraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert placed on your credit \nreport if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.  An extended fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for seven years.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any \nof the three national credit reporting agencies.\nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free \nof charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you \nwhen you initiate a freeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your \ncredit report without your consent.  If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not \nbe able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore, using a security freeze \nmay delay your ability to obtain credit.  There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you \nmust separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.  For information and \ninstructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:\n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com\nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com \n\nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n\n1.

This letter \nexplains the incident, measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.\nOn August  28,  2018,  our  security  team  observed  suspicious  activity  on  our  website.

On  September  10,  2018,  the  investigation \nidentified the potential for unauthorized access to payment card data. Findings from the investigation suggest that \ncertain of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 order information and payment card information, including name, address, payment card \nnumber, expiration date, and card security code (CVV), may have been obtained by an unauthorized third party. We \nbelieve the incident only involved customers who placed or attempted to place orders on our website between August \n14, 2018 and August 28, 2018 or between September 18, 2018 and September 19, 2018. We are notifying you because \nyou placed or attempted an order on www.fivebelow.com during those time periods using a payment card ending in \n<<variable data>>. Purchases made in our stores were not affected by this incident.\nWe  encourage  you  to  closely  review  your  payment  card  statements  for  any  unauthorized  charges.  You  should \nimmediately report any such charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally \nprovide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported. The phone number to \ncall is usually on the back of your payment card.  \nTo date, we have no information that any of your personal information was misused in any way. As a precaution, we have \nsecured the services of Experian to offer you a complimentary one-year membership of Experian\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xae IdentityWorksSM. \nThis product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft services.

You are receiving this \nletter  because  you  have  purchased  products  from  the  CJ  Products  website,  www.pillowpets.com  during  the  period \nbeginning August 30, 2017 and ending April 9, 2018.  \n \nWhat Happened?  \n \nAfter noticing an unusual code imbedded within our website, on April 18, 2017, we hired a specialized forensic IT firm to \ninvestigate. On January 28, 2019, the specialized forensic IT firm determined that there was unauthorized access to our \nwebsite code from a foreign IP address between August 30, 2017 and April 9, 2018.   The code was immediately removed \nfrom the site and measures were immediately implemented to prevent further access to customer information.  As a result \nof  this  access,  Credit  Card  data  inputted  by  customers  is  considered  at  risk  of  exposure.  Accordingly,  we  are  notifying \neveryone whose information passed through our system out of an abundance of caution.  \n \nWhat Information Was Involved?  \n \nAs  a  customer  of  pillowpets.com  during  the  aforementioned  period,  the  information  on  our  system  may  have  included \nyour: first and last name, address and credit card number.  \n \nWhat We Are Doing.  \n \nIn  addition  to  the  steps  outlined  above,  we  notified  the  local  Police  Department,  all  three  credit  bureaus,  and  the \napplicable state agencies of this incident. Further, we are reviewing office policies and procedures to ensure all security \nmeasures are taken to avoid such an incident from occurring again. In this endeavor, we hired IT specialists to determine \nwhat  happened  and  confirm  the  security  of  our  network.  Lastly,  we  are  working  with  law  enforcement  in  their \ninvestigation of the criminals.  \n \nWhat You Can Do.  \n \nWe recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open \nany new accounts or change your existing accounts. Call any one of the three major credit bureaus. As soon as one credit \nbureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. The initial fraud alert stays on your credit \nreport for 90 days. You can renew it after 90 days.  \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nEquifax: equifax.com or 1-800-525-6285  \nExperian: experian.com or 1-888-397-3742  \nTransUnion: transunion.com or 1-800-680-7289  \n \n\nRequest that all three credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review. Even if you do not find any suspicious \nactivity  on  your  initial  credit  reports,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  recommends  that  you  check  your  credit \nreports  periodically.  Thieves  may  hold  stolen  information  to  use  at  different  times.  Checking  your  credit  reports \nperiodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.  \n \nIf you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, file a \npolice report. Get a copy of the police report; you may need it to clear up the fraudulent debts.  \n \nIf your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an \nidentity  theft  complaint.  Your  complaint  will  be  added  to  the  FTC\xe2\x80\x99s  Consumer  Sentinel  Network,  where  it  will  be \naccessible to law enforcers for their investigations. 12 You also may want to consider contacting the major credit bureaus \nat the telephone numbers above to place a credit freeze on your credit file. A credit freeze means potential creditors cannot \nget your credit report. That makes it less likely that an identify thief can open new accounts in your name.

An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.

A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing \nyour credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be \nable to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay \nyour ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws \nvary  from  state  to  state.  The  cost  of  placing,  temporarily  lifting,  and  removing  a  credit  freeze  also  varies  by  state, \ngenerally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit \nfreeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ \nfrom  state  to  state,  please  contact  the  three  major  credit  reporting  companies  as  specified  below  to  find  out  more \ninformation: \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nEquifax: P.O.

This event relates to documentation associated \nwith your mortgage loan, which is (or may have been at one time) held by Stanwich. Although we are not aware of \nany identity theft or fraud occurring as a result of this event, we are writing to provide you with information on the \nevent, steps Ascension and Stanwich are taking in response, and steps you may take to better protect against the \npossibility of identity theft and fraud from any source, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.\n\nWhat Happened? Ascension provides data analytics in connection with residential mortgage loans which are or may \nhave been held by Stanwich. As part of its services, Ascension has custody of certain data related to the Stanwich \nloans and contracts with a third-party vendor, PairPrep, Inc., d/b/a OpticsML (\xe2\x80\x9cOpticsML\xe2\x80\x9d) to process that data using \ncertain technology. \n\nOn January 15, 2019, Ascension and Stanwich were informed of a potential incident involving OpticsML. An investigation, \nsupported by third-party forensic experts, was immediately commenced to determine the nature and scope of the event. \nBeginning on January 25, 2019, Ascension and Stanwich confirmed that two cloud-servers belonging to OpticsML were \nsubject to unauthorized access by foreign IP addresses, and that the data hosted on those servers could have been \nacquired as early as February 2018 until January 2019. \n\nWhat Information Was Involved? Although the investigation is ongoing, Ascension and Stanwich determined that \nthe following types of your information may have been on the servers, and could have been subject to unauthorized \naccess or acquisition: name; address; Social Security number; loan information; bank account, credit, or debit card \ninformation; driver\xe2\x80\x99s license number; date of birth; credit file; and any other information you may have provided as part \nof your mortgage loan application. The types of information listed above were not necessarily impacted for everyone. \n\nWhat We Are Doing. We take the protection of personal information very seriously. The information has been \ntaken offline and law enforcement has been notified. Although a third-party (OpticsML) was in possession of the \ninformation that was exposed, and we are not aware of any identity theft or fraud occurring as a result of this event, \nto illustrate our commitment to the protection of personal information, we have arranged to have Kroll make available \nat no cost to you credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for two (2) years.

Credit Freeze You have the right to put a security freeze, also known as a credit freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to access your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact all three major consumer reporting agencies listed below.  Equifax P.O. Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348-5788 1-800-685-1111 www.equifax.com/personal/ credit-report-services Experian P.O.

Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016-2000 1-888-909-8872 www.transunion.com/ credit-freeze  You must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting agency. The following information should be included when requesting a credit freeze:  1) Full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; 2) Social Security number; 3) Date of birth (month, day, and year); 4) Current address and previous addresses for the past five (5) years; 5) Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill; 6) Other personal information as required by the applicable credit reporting agency;  If you request a credit freeze online or by phone, then the credit reporting agencies have one (1) business day after receiving your request to place a credit freeze on your credit file report. If you request a lift of the credit freeze online or by phone, then the credit reporting agency must lift the freeze within one (1) hour. If you request a credit freeze or lift of a credit freeze by mail, then the credit agency must place or lift the credit freeze no later than three (3) business days after getting your request.  Fraud Alerts You also have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert lasts 1-year and is placed on a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below. The agency you contact will then contact the other two credit agencies.  Equifax P.O.

If you see any service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your insurer at the number on the statement. If you do not receive regular explanation of benefits statements, contact your provider and request them to send such statements following the provision of services in your name or number.  You may want to order copies of your credit reports and check for any medical bills that you do not recognize. If you find anything suspicious, call the credit reporting agency at the phone number on the report. Keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your medical records.

Although Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 did not experience a data security breach involving itsinternal systems, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been informed that third-parties obtained usernames and passwords through othercompanies\xe2\x80\x99 security breaches and used this information to log into some Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 DD Perks accounts. One ofthese may have been your account and we want you to know what happened, as well as the steps we are takingto protect your personal information.What Happened?Beginning on or around January 10, 2019, we learned from one of our security vendors that a third-partymay have attempted to log in to your DD Perks account. We believe that these third-parties obtainedusernames and passwords from security breaches of other companies. These individuals then used theusernames and passwords to try to break in to various online accounts across the Internet. Our securityvendor was successful in stopping most of these attempts, but it is possible that these third-parties mayhave succeeded in logging in to your DD Perks account if you used your DD Perks username andpassword for accounts unrelated to Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99.What Information Was Involved?The information involved depends on what you had in your DD Perks account. Information these third-partiesmay have been able to access includes:-Your first and last names,-Email address (username), and-Your 16-digit DD Perks account number and your DD Perks QR codeWhat We Are DoingWe immediately launched an internal investigation and have been working with our security vendor toremediate this event and to help prevent this kind of event from occurring in the future. We forced apassword reset that required all of the potentially impacted DD Perks account holders to log out and logback in to their account using a new password. We also have taken steps to replace any DD Perks storedvalue cards with a new account number, but retaining the same value that was previously present on thosecards.\x0cWhat You Can DoAs always, we strongly recommend that our guests create unique passwords for their DD Perks accounts, anddo not reuse passwords used for their other unrelated online accounts.

Credit Freeze You have the right to put a security freeze, also known as a credit freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.

You should \nalso contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police \nreport in case you are asked to provide  copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for \nthe Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal  Trade  Commission,  Consumer  Response  Center,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) \n \n\nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors \non notice that you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert.  You may ask that an initial \nfraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity \ntheft.  An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert \nplaced  on  your  credit  report  if  you  have  already  been  a  victim  of  identity  theft  with  the  appropriate \ndocumentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.  You can place a \nfraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies. \n \nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit \nfile, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that \nis issued to you when you initiate a freeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors \nfrom accessing your credit report without your consent.  If you place a security freeze, potential creditors \nand other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the \nfreeze.  Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  There is no fee to place \nor lift a security freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file \nat each credit reporting company.

Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, \n\nmilitary identification, etc.) \n\n7.  If  you  are  a  victim  of identity  theft,  include  a  copy  of  the  police  report, investigative  report,  or \n\ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or \nsecure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security \nfreeze on your credit report.  The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five \nbusiness days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both \nthat can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to \nlift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone \nnumber, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request \nvia regular, certified, or overnight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification \n(name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you \nplaced the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive \nyour credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available.  The credit reporting \nagencies  have  one  business  day  after  receiving  your  request  by  toll-free  telephone  or  secure  electronic \nmeans,  or  three  business  days  after  receiving  your  request  by  mail,  to  lift  the  security  freeze  for  those \nidentified entities or for the specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure \nelectronic  means  maintained  by  a  credit  reporting  agency,  or  by  sending  a  written  request  via  regular, \ncertified,  or  overnight  mail  to  each  of  the  three  credit  bureaus  and  include  proper  identification  (name, \naddress, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed \nthe  security  freeze.

You can obtain information from these  sources about steps an individual \ncan take to avoid identity theft as well as information about  fraud alerts and security freezes. You should \nalso contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police \nreport in case you are asked to provide  copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for \nthe Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal  Trade  Commission,  Consumer  Response  Center,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) \n \n\nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors \non notice that you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert.  You may ask that an initial \nfraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity \ntheft.  An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert \nplaced  on  your  credit  report  if  you  have  already  been  a  victim  of  identity  theft  with  the  appropriate \ndocumentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.  You can place a \nfraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies. \n \nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit \nfile, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that \nis issued to you when you initiate a freeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors \nfrom accessing your credit report without your consent.  If you place a security freeze, potential creditors \nand other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the \nfreeze.  Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  There is no fee to place \nor lift a security freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file \nat each credit reporting company.  For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each \nof the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below: \n  \n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \n\n  \nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior \n\n \n\n\x0cfive years \n\n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, \n\nmilitary identification, etc.) \n\n7.  If  you  are  a  victim  of identity  theft,  include  a  copy  of  the  police  report, investigative  report,  or \n\ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or \nsecure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security \nfreeze on your credit report.  The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five \nbusiness days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both \nthat can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to \nlift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone \nnumber, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request \nvia regular, certified, or overnight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification \n(name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you \nplaced the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive \nyour credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available.  The credit reporting \nagencies  have  one  business  day  after  receiving  your  request  by  toll-free  telephone  or  secure  electronic \nmeans,  or  three  business  days  after  receiving  your  request  by  mail,  to  lift  the  security  freeze  for  those \nidentified entities or for the specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure \nelectronic  means  maintained  by  a  credit  reporting  agency,  or  by  sending  a  written  request  via  regular, \ncertified,  or  overnight  mail  to  each  of  the  three  credit  bureaus  and  include  proper  identification  (name, \naddress, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed \nthe  security  freeze.

Box 105281,\nAtlanta, GA 30348-5281.  The three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the\nwebsite, toll-free number or request form.\n\nUpon receiving your credit report, review it carefully.  Errors may be a warning sign of possible identity\ntheft.  Here are a few tips of what to look for:\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\nLook for accounts you did not open.  \nLook  in  the  \xc2\x93inquiries\xc2\x94  section  for  names  of  creditors  from  whom  you  have  not  requested\ncredit.    Some  companies  bill  under  names  other  than  their  store  or  commercial  names;  the\ncredit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case.  \nLook  in  the  \xc2\x93personal  information\xc2\x94  section  for  any  inaccuracies  in  information  (such  as  home\naddress and Social Security Number).  \n\nIf  you  see  anything  you  do  not  understand,  call  the  credit  bureau  at  the  telephone  number  on  the\nreport.  You should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error\nor  fraud,  as  soon  as  possible  so  the  information  can  be  investigated  and,  if  found  to  be  in  error,\ncorrected.  If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate\ncredit  bureau  by  telephone  and  in  writing.    Information  that  cannot  be  explained  should  also  be\nreported to your local police or sheriff\xc2\x92s office because it may signal criminal activity.\n\nContact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission  \n\nIf  you  detect  any  unauthorized  transactions  in  any  of  your  financial  accounts,  promptly  notify  the\nappropriate payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incidence of identity theft\nor fraud, promptly report the matter to your local law enforcement authorities, state Attorney General\nand the FTC. \n\nYou  can  contact  the  FTC  to  learn  more  about  how  to  protect  yourself  from  becoming  a  victim  of\nidentity theft by using the contact information below:\n\nFederal Trade Commission\nConsumer Response Center\n600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\nWashington, D.C. 20580\n1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338)\nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft/ \n\nPlace a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File  \n\nTo  protect  yourself  from  possible  identity  theft,  consider  placing  a  fraud  alert  on  your  credit  file.    A\nfraud alert helps protect against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your\nname.    When  a  credit  grantor  checks  the  credit  history  of  someone  applying  for  credit,  the  credit\ngrantor gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft.  The alert notifies the credit\ngrantor to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit\nreport by calling any one of the toll-free fraud numbers provided below.  You will reach an automated\ntelephone system that allows flagging of your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.\n\nE3980-L01\n\n\x0cEquifax Fraud Reporting\n1-866-349-5191\nP.O.

For this reason, we are contacting you \ndirectly to explain the circumstances of the incident.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nOn October 26, 2018, the Association of National Advertisers, Inc. (ANA) learned of suspicious activity indicating a \npossible data security incident. A forensic investigation revealed that an unauthorized user had gained access to the \nbusiness email account of an ANA employee through what is known as a \xe2\x80\x9cphishing\xe2\x80\x9d attack. The intruder accessed \nthe employee\xe2\x80\x99s account from August 10, 2018 to October 29, 2018 and had the ability to download the contents of \nthe employee\xe2\x80\x99s business mailbox during that time. The ANA has cooperated with law enforcement regarding this \nsecurity incident. That cooperation did not delay this noti\xef\xac\x81cation.\n\nWhat information was involved?\n\nThe compromised mailbox included your name and social security number. The ANA does not know if this \ninformation has been used for a fraudulent purpose.\n\nWhat we are doing.\n\nThe ANA takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard personal information. Upon learning of the suspicious \nactivity, the ANA took measures to contain the incident and to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the \nfuture, including engaging a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and extent of the breach, and \nenhancing its security and employee training procedures to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.\n\nTo help relieve concerns and restore con\xef\xac\x81dence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to \nprovide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year.

An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if \nyou have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.

To  order  your  annual  free  credit  report,  please  visit \nwww.annualcreditreport.com  or  call  toll  free  at  1-877-322-8228.   Contact  information  for  the  three  nationwide  credit \nreporting companies is as follows:  \n\n  \nExperian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742 \nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800 \nEquifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111 \n\n \nIf you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal  information has been misused, \nyou should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission  and/or the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office in  your state. You \ncan obtain information from these  sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information \nabout  fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police \nreport.   Obtain  a  copy  of  the  police  report  in  case  you  are  asked  to  provide  copies  to  creditors  to  correct  your \nrecords.  Contact information for the Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20580, \n1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft \n\n  \nIf you are a resident of Maryland or North Carolina you may contact and obtain information from your state attorney \ngeneral at:  \n  \n\nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us, 1-\n888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) or  \n410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n \nNorth  Carolina  Attorney  General\xe2\x80\x99s  Office,  9001  Mail  Service  Center,  Raleigh,  NC \n27699, www.ncdoj.gov, 1-919-716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226 \n\n \n\n \nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that \nyou may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert.  You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on \nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.  An initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already \nbeen a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report \nfor seven years.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting \nagencies. \n\nCredit Freezes:   You  have  the  right  to  put  a  credit  freeze,  also  known  as  a  security  freeze,  on  your  credit  file,  free  of \ncharge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you \ninitiate  a  freeze. A  security  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from  accessing  your  credit  report \nwithout your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access \nto your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to \nobtain credit.  \n\nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your \ncredit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the \ncredit reporting agencies at the addresses below: \n\n  \n\n \n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \n\n \n\n\x0c \nTo request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you  have lived over the prior five years \n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A  legible  photocopy  of  a  government  issued  identification  card  (state  driver's  license  or  ID  card,  military \n\nidentification, etc.) \n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report,  investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning  identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a  security freeze on your credit report. The \ncredit  bureaus  must  also  send  written  confirmation  to  you  within  five  business  days  and  provide  you  with  a  unique \npersonal identification number  (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of \nthe  security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit  report, or to lift a security \nfreeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to \nthe credit reporting agencies and  include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN \nnumber  or  password  provided  to  you  when  you  placed  the  security  freeze  as  well  as  the  identity  of  those  entities  or \nindividuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time  you want the credit report available. \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days  after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities \nor for the  specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means \nmaintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to each of \nthe  three  credit  bureaus  and  include  proper  identification  (name,  address,  and  Social  Security  number)  and  the  PIN \nnumber or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit  bureaus have one business day after \nreceiving  your  request  by  toll-free  telephone  or  secure  electronic  means,  or  three  business  days  after  receiving  your \nrequest by mail, to remove the security freeze. \n \nFair  Credit  Reporting  Act:  You  also  have  rights  under  the  federal  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  which  promotes  the \naccuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.

Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring \n\ncredit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of \n\nthe three  major credit  reporting  companies. To  obtain  a  free annual credit  report,  go  to  www.annualcreditreport.com  or \n\ncall 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit \n\nbureaus every four months.  \n\n \n\nIf you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging \n\ninto the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help.  \n\n \n\nIf you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who \n\nwill help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a \n\nconsequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop \n\nand reverse the damage quickly.  \n\nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that \n\nin order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide \n\nsome  kind  of  proof  that  you  have  been  a  victim.  A  police report is  often required  to  dispute fraudulent  items.  You  can \n\nreport suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.  \n\n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after \n\nactivating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also \n\nvia Experian\xe2\x80\x99s or Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, \n\nbefore  they  open  any  new  accounts  or  change  your  existing  accounts.

You also have the right to request a security freeze.\n\nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report \nif you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert \nstays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the \nthree national credit reporting agencies.\n\nIf you are a resident of West Virginia, you have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting agencies place \n\xe2\x80\x9cfraud alerts\xe2\x80\x9d in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft, as described \nbelow. You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below.\n\n\x0cCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of \ncharge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN that is issued to you when you \ninitiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report \nwithout your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get \naccess to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your \nability to obtain credit.\n\nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on \nyour credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact \neach of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com\n\xe2\x80\xa2  TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\n\nTo request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)\n2.  Social Security number\n3.  Date of birth\n4.  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years\n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill\n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or ID card, military \n\nidentification, etc.)\n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning identity theft\n\nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure \nelectronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your \ncredit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide \nyou with a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize \nthe removal or lifting of the security freeze.\n\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security \nfreeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to \nthe credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN \nor password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals \nyou would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The credit \nreporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, \nor three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the \nspecified period of time.\n\nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail \nto each of the three credit bureaus and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) \nand the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have one \nbusiness day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days \nafter receiving your request by mail, to remove the security freeze.\n\nFair Credit Reporting Act: You also have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, which promotes the \naccuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. The FTC has published a list of \nthe primary rights created by the FCRA (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf), and \nthat article refers individuals seeking more information to visit www.ftc.gov/credit. The FTC\xe2\x80\x99s list of FCRA rights includes:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  You have the right to receive a copy of your credit report.

You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2  You may limit \xe2\x80\x9cprescreened\xe2\x80\x9d offers of credit and insurance you receive based on information in your credit report.\n\xe2\x80\xa2  You may seek damages from violators.\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.\n\nTAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR IDENTITY MONITORING SERVICES\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been provided with access to the following services1 from Kroll:\n\nSingle Bureau Credit Monitoring\nYou will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data\xe2\x80\x94for instance, when a new line of credit is applied \nfor in your name.

Activate  the  credit  monitoring  provided  as  part  of  your  MyIDCare  membership.  The  monitoring  included  in  the \n\nmembership must be activated to be effective.

Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring \n\ncredit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of \n\nthe three  major credit  reporting  companies. To  obtain  a  free annual credit  report,  go  to  www.annualcreditreport.com  or \n\ncall 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit \n\nbureaus every four months.  \n\n \n\nIf you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging \n\ninto the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help.  \n\n \n\nIf you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who \n\nwill help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a \n\nconsequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop \n\nand reverse the damage quickly.  \n\nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that \n\nin order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide \n\nsome  kind  of  proof  that  you  have  been  a  victim.  A  police report is  often required  to  dispute fraudulent  items.  You  can \n\nreport suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.  \n\n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after \n\nactivating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also \n\nvia Experian\xe2\x80\x99s or Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, \n\nbefore  they  open  any  new  accounts  or  change  your  existing  accounts.  For  that reason,  placing  a  fraud  alert  can  protect \n\nyou, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows: \n\nCredit Bureaus  \n\nEquifax Fraud Reporting \n\nExperian Fraud Reporting \n\nTransUnion Fraud Reporting \n\n1-866-349-5191 \n\nP.O.

Box 2000 \n\nChester, PA 19022-2000 \n\nwww.transunion.com   \n\n\x0c \n\nIt  is  necessary  to contact  only  ONE  of  these  bureaus and  use  only  ONE  of  these  methods.  As  soon  as  one  of the three \n\nbureaus  confirms  your  fraud  alert,  the  others  are  notified  to  place  alerts  on  their  records  as  well.

You \ncan obtain information from these  sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information \nabout  fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police \nreport.   Obtain  a  copy  of  the  police  report  in  case  you  are  asked  to  provide  copies  to  creditors  to  correct  your \nrecords.  Contact information for the Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20580, \n1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft \n\n  \nIf you are a resident of Maryland or North Carolina you may contact and obtain information from your state attorney \ngeneral at:  \n  \n\nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us, 1-\n888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) or  \n410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n \nNorth  Carolina  Attorney  General\xe2\x80\x99s  Office,  9001  Mail  Service  Center,  Raleigh,  NC \n27699, www.ncdoj.gov, 1-919-716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226 \n\n \n\n \nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that \nyou may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert.  You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on \nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.  An initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already \nbeen a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report \nfor seven years.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting \nagencies. \n\nCredit Freezes:   You  have  the  right  to  put  a  credit  freeze,  also  known  as  a  security  freeze,  on  your  credit  file,  free  of \ncharge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you \ninitiate  a  freeze. A  security  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from  accessing  your  credit  report \nwithout your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access \nto your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to \nobtain credit.  \n\nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your \ncredit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the \ncredit reporting agencies at the addresses below: \n\n  \n\n \n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \n\n \n\n\x0c \nTo request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you  have lived over the prior five years \n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A  legible  photocopy  of  a  government  issued  identification  card  (state  driver's  license  or  ID  card,  military \n\nidentification, etc.) \n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report,  investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning  identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a  security freeze on your credit report. The \ncredit  bureaus  must  also  send  written  confirmation  to  you  within  five  business  days  and  provide  you  with  a  unique \npersonal identification number  (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of \nthe  security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit  report, or to lift a security \nfreeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to \nthe credit reporting agencies and  include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN \nnumber  or  password  provided  to  you  when  you  placed  the  security  freeze  as  well  as  the  identity  of  those  entities  or \nindividuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time  you want the credit report available. \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days  after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities \nor for the  specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means \nmaintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to each of \nthe  three  credit  bureaus  and  include  proper  identification  (name,  address,  and  Social  Security  number)  and  the  PIN \nnumber or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit  bureaus have one business day after \nreceiving  your  request  by  toll-free  telephone  or  secure  electronic  means,  or  three  business  days  after  receiving  your \nrequest by mail, to remove the security freeze. \n \nFair  Credit  Reporting  Act:  You  also  have  rights  under  the  federal  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  which  promotes  the \naccuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.

We regret \nthis situation and any inconvenience or concern it may cause you. We have set forth below information about the \nsteps you can take to protect yourself following this incident.  Please review this information carefully.\nWhat Happened?\nIn  late  December  2018,  ALM  learned  that  an  unknown  third  party  had  uploaded  unauthorized  code  to  several \ne-commerce pages used to process payments for various products sold under The National Underwriter and Judy \nDiamond brands. ALM quickly commenced an investigation to understand the capabilities of this code and engaged \nthird-party cybersecurity experts to assist with this analysis. We also promptly disabled the checkout page on the \naffected sites while we worked to remove the unauthorized code pending the results of our investigation. On December \n28, 2018, ALM determined that the code was designed to collect and transmit to an unknown third party the payment \ncard details of customers making purchases on the affected sites. ALM determined that the unauthorized code was \npresent on the affected websites from July 7, 2018 until December 24, 2018.\nWhat Information Was Involved?\nThe data elements collected and transmitted by the malicious script included a customer\xe2\x80\x99s name, billing/shipping \naddress, telephone and fax number, payment card account number, payment card expiration date, and the payment \ncard verification number (i.e., the number printed on the front or back of your payment card used in online transactions \nto verify that you possess the card).\nWhat We Are Doing.\nWe have removed the malicious code from the sites in question and taken steps in response to this incident to better \nwithstand these types of cyber-attacks on our e-commerce platform in the future.

If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, be sure to \n\nW8471 v.04 01.18.2019\n\n\x0creport it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from \nrequiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported.

You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if \nyou have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.

You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below.\nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.

We are writing to inform you that we \nrecently identified and addressed a security incident that may have involved your information. This notice explains the \nincident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response. \n \nOn November 13, 2018, we discovered unauthorized code on our website. The unauthorized code was removed and we \nworked with a leading cyber security firm to investigate the incident. The investigation determined that the unauthorized \ncode was added by an unauthorized individual so that payment card information entered by purchasers on our e-commerce \nwebsite was copied and sent to an unauthorized server. The code was added on November 12, 2018 and removed on \nNovember 13, 2018. Because you made a purchase on the website between November 12 and 13, 2018, it is possible that \nyour  information  was  involved.  This  information  includes  your  name,  address,  email  address,  password  to  our  e-\ncommerce  website,  order  information,  payment  card  number  ending  in  [XXXX],  card  expiration  date,  and  the  card \nverification code (CVV). \n \nWe have reset your password to your account with us and you will be prompted to create a new one next time you attempt \nto  login.  If  you  use  the  same  username  and  password  for  any  other  account,  we  recommend  that  you  change  your \npassword there as well. We encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. \nYou  should  immediately  report  any  such  charges  to  the  bank  that  issued  your  card.  If  reported  timely,  payment  card \nnetwork rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges. Information on additional \nsteps you can take can be found on the following pages.  \n \nWe regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. To help prevent this type of incident from \nhappening again, we are taking steps to strengthen the security of our website, and have already moved to a more secure \ncheck-out method.  \n \nIf you have questions, please call (844) 322-8227, Monday \xe2\x80\x93 Friday, from 10am \xe2\x80\x93 7pm, Central Time.  \n \nSincerely, \n\nAlex Jones \nOwner \n(Enclosure) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE \n\n \nWe recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and \nfree credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

78,Infowarstore.com-Free Speech Systems ,"b"" \n\nPO Box 10680 \nDublin, OH 43017-9380 \n \n \n<First Name><Last Name> \n<Address> \n<City>, <State> <Zip Code> \n \n\nDecember 14, 2018 \n\n \n \nDear <<Name 1>>: \n \nFree Speech Systems, LLC, which operates the e-commerce store, inforwarsstore.com, values the relationship we have \nwith our customers and understands the importance of protecting your information. We are writing to inform you that we \nrecently identified and addressed a security incident that may have involved your information. This notice explains the \nincident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response. \n \nOn November 13, 2018, we discovered unauthorized code on our website. The unauthorized code was removed and we \nworked with a leading cyber security firm to investigate the incident. The investigation determined that the unauthorized \ncode was added by an unauthorized individual so that payment card information entered by purchasers on our e-commerce \nwebsite was copied and sent to an unauthorized server. The code was added on November 12, 2018 and removed on \nNovember 13, 2018. Because you made a purchase on the website between November 12 and 13, 2018, it is possible that \nyour  information  was  involved.  This  information  includes  your  name,  address,  email  address,  password  to  our  e-\ncommerce  website,  order  information,  payment  card  number  ending  in  [XXXX],  card  expiration  date,  and  the  card \nverification code (CVV). \n \nWe have reset your password to your account with us and you will be prompted to create a new one next time you attempt \nto  login.  If  you  use  the  same  username  and  password  for  any  other  account,  we  recommend  that  you  change  your \npassword there as well. We encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. \nYou  should  immediately  report  any  such  charges  to  the  bank  that  issued  your  card.  If  reported  timely,  payment  card \nnetwork rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges. Information on additional \nsteps you can take can be found on the following pages.  \n \nWe regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. To help prevent this type of incident from \nhappening again, we are taking steps to strengthen the security of our website, and have already moved to a more secure \ncheck-out method.  \n \nIf you have questions, please call (844) 322-8227, Monday \xe2\x80\x93 Friday, from 10am \xe2\x80\x93 7pm, Central Time.  \n \nSincerely, \n\nAlex Jones \nOwner \n(Enclosure) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE \n\n \nWe recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and \nfree credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once  every \n12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your  annual free credit report, please \nvisit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit \nreporting companies is as follows:  \n\n  \nEquifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111 \nExperian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742 \nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800 \n\n  \nIf you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal  information has been misused, \nyou should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission  and/or the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office in your state. You \ncan obtain information from these  sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information \nabout  fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police \nreport. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide  copies to creditors to correct your records. \nContact information for the Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20580, \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) \n\n  \nIf you are a resident of Connecticut, Maryland, or North Carolina, you may contact and obtain information from your \nstate attorney general at:  \n  \n\nConnecticut Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 55 Elm Street, Hartford, CT 06106 \nwww.ct.gov/ag, 1-860-808-5318 \n \nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202 \nwww.oag.state.md.us, 1-888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) \n1-410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n\n \n  \n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, www.ncdoj.gov, 1-919-\n716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226 \n\n \nIf you are a resident of West Virginia, you have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting agencies place \n\xe2\x80\x9cfraud alerts\xe2\x80\x9d in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft, as described \nbelow. You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below. \n \nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that \nyou may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on \nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been \na victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for \nseven  years.  You  can  place  a  fraud  alert  on  your  credit  report  by  contacting  any  of  the  three  national  credit  reporting \nagencies. \n \nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of \ncharge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you \ninitiate  a  freeze.  A  security  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from  accessing  your  credit  report \nwithout your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access \nto your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to \nobtain credit.  \nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your \ncredit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the \ncredit reporting agencies at the addresses below: \n\n\x0c  \n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \n\n  \nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years \n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A  legible  photocopy  of  a  government  issued  identification  card  (state  driver's  license  or  ID  card,  military \n\nidentification, etc.) \n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit report. The \ncredit  bureaus  must  also  send  written  confirmation  to  you  within  five  business  days  and  provide  you  with  a  unique \npersonal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of \nthe security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security \nfreeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to \nthe credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN \nnumber  or  password  provided  to  you  when  you  placed  the  security  freeze  as  well  as  the  identity  of  those  entities  or \nindividuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or \nfor the specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means \nmaintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to each of \nthe  three  credit  bureaus  and  include  proper  identification  (name,  address,  and  Social  Security  number)  and  the  PIN \nnumber or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have one business day after \nreceiving  your  request  by  toll-free  telephone  or  secure  electronic  means,  or  three  business  days  after  receiving  your \nrequest by mail, to remove the security freeze. \n \nFair  Credit  Reporting  Act:  You  also  have  rights  under  the  federal  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  which  promotes  the \naccuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. The FTC has published a list of \nthe  primary  rights  created  by  the  FCRA  (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf), \nand that article refers individuals seeking more information to visit www.ftc.gov/credit.  \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \nThe FTC\xe2\x80\x99s list of FCRA rights includes: \n \n\n(cid:120)  You  have  the  right  to  receive  a  copy  of  your  credit  report.  The  copy  of  your  report  must  contain  all  the \n\ninformation in your file at the time of your request. \n\n(cid:120)  Each of the nationwide credit reporting companies \xe2\x80\x93 Experian, TransUnion and Equifax \xe2\x80\x93 is required to provide \n\nyou with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. \n\n(cid:120)  You are also entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, like denying your application \nfor credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. \nThe  notice  will  give  you  the  name,  address,  and  phone  number  of  the  credit  reporting  company.  You\xe2\x80\x99re  also \nentitled to one free report a year if you\xe2\x80\x99re unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you\xe2\x80\x99re on \nwelfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity theft. \n\n(cid:120)  You have the right to ask for a credit score.  \n(cid:120)  You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. \n(cid:120)  Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.  \n(cid:120)  Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. \n(cid:120)  Access to your file is limited.

Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies \nfor the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries, including obtaining \ninformation about fraud alerts and placing a security freeze on your credit files, is as follows: \n\nExperian \n1-888-397-3742 \nwww.experian.com \nP.O. Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n\nEquifax \n1-800-349-9960 \nwww.equifax.com \nP.O. Box 105788 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n \nFraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert \nis free and will stay on your credit file for at least ninety (90) days. The alert informs creditors of possible \nfraudulent  activity  within  your  report  and  requests  that  the  creditor  contact  you  prior  to  establishing \nany new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three \nnational credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is \navailable at www.annualcreditreport.com. \n\nTransUnion \n1-888-909-8872 \nwww.transunion.com \nP.O. Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19022 \n\nCredit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security \nfreeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN \nnumber  that  is  issued  to  you  when  you  initiate  the  freeze.  A  credit  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent \npotential credit  grantors from accessing your credit report without  your consent. If you place  a credit \nfreeze,  potential  creditors  and  other  third  parties  will  not  be  able  to  get  access  to  your  credit  report \nunless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain \ncredit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit \nreporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, \nplease contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above. \n\nIn order to request a security freeze, you may need to provide the following information: \n \n1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.); \n2. Social Security Number; \n3. Date of birth; \n\n \n\nPage 4 \n\n\x0c \n \n \nCredit Report Information \n\n4.  If  you  have  moved  in  the  past  five (5)  years,  provide  the  addresses  where  you  have  lived  over  the \nprior five years; \n5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill; \n6.  A  legible  photocopy  of  a  government  issued  identification  card  (state  driver\xe2\x80\x99s  license  or  ID  card, \nmilitary identification, etc.); \n7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or \ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft; \n \nThe  credit  reporting  agencies  have  three  (3)  business  days  after  receiving  your  request  to  place  a \nsecurity  freeze  on  your  credit  report.

Upon \nlearning about this incident, Synchrony Bank promptly began working with Stein Mart, Inc. to \ngather data that would allow us to clearly determine what had occurred. \n\nStein Mart, Inc. has advised us that a web site application provided by a third-party vendor of \nStein Mart, Inc., and used on www.steinmart.com, contained unauthorized code. The \ninformation entered by you when you used your credit card to complete your purchase on \nwww.steinmart.com may have been targeted by this unauthorized code. Unfortunately, this may \nhave allowed access to some of your personal information including your name, address, email \naddress, credit account number, security code and expiration date for your [card name]. We \nunderstand the unauthorized code was removed and the third-party vendor\xe2\x80\x99s login feature was \nalso removed from the website. It is important to note that this incident did not result from any \nactions by Synchrony Bank or compromise of any of our systems or processes.    \n\nAs a result of this incident, a new credit card may be issued to you with updated security \ncredentials.  In addition, we would like to offer you a one-year subscription to a credit report \nmonitoring service at no cost to you. If you would like to receive the credit report monitoring \nservice or have any questions, contact us at 1-866-834-3206 (Monday through Friday from 8 \na.m. to 5 p.m. ET) within 90 days of the date on this letter. \n\nTo protect yourself further, you may also consider:  \n\n1.  Placing a fraud alert on your credit files: The fraud alert is free and will require that \npotential creditors to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name, thereby \nreducing or hopefully eliminating the likelihood of an unauthorized account. The fraud \nalert is renewable every 90 days. A call to any one of the three credit reporting agencies \nlisted below will place a fraud alert on your credit file with all three agencies. You will \nreceive letters from the agencies confirming the fraud alert and informing you about how \nto get a free copy of your credit report.

Obtaining and reviewing your credit bureau report:  Examine it carefully, looking for \n\naccounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors you did not initiate or personal \ninformation that is not accurate and contact the credit reporting agency that provided the \nreport with any questions. If you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports, you \nshould also contact your local police or Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office to file a report of identity theft. \nMake sure to ask for a copy of the police report as you may need to provide copies to \ncreditors to clear up your records. Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your \nreports, it\xe2\x80\x99s always good idea to review your credit bureau reports periodically to make \nsure they are accurate.   \n \n\n3.  Adding a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d on your credit file:  A \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d will prevent new credit \n\naccounts from being opened in your name without the use of a Personal Identification \nNumber (PIN) that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze.

We have taken measures to\ninvestigate and address a data security incident involving the Starwood\nguest reservation database. The investigation has determined that\nthere was unauthorized access to the database, which contained guest\ninformation relating to reservations at Starwood properties* on or\nbefore September 10, 2018. This notice explains what happened,\nmeasures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.\n\n\x0cStarwood Guest Reservation Database Security Incident\n\nOn September 8, 2018, Marriott received an alert from an internal\nsecurity tool regarding an attempt to access the Starwood guest\nreservation database. Marriott quickly engaged leading security experts\nto help determine what occurred. Marriott learned during the\ninvestigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood\nnetwork since 2014. Marriott recently discovered that an unauthorized\nparty had copied and encrypted information, and took steps towards\nremoving it. On November 19, 2018, Marriott was able to decrypt the\ninformation and determined that the contents were from the Starwood\nguest reservation database.\n\nMarriott has not finished identifying duplicate information in the\ndatabase, but believes it contains information on up to approximately\n500 million guests who made a reservation at a Starwood property. For\napproximately 327 million of these guests, the information includes\nsome combination of name, mailing address, phone number, email\naddress, passport number, Starwood Preferred Guest (""SPG"") account\ninformation, date of birth, gender, arrival and departure information,\nreservation date, and communication preferences. For some, the\ninformation also includes payment card numbers and payment card\nexpiration dates, but the payment card numbers were encrypted using\nAdvanced Encryption Standard encryption (AES-128). There are two\ncomponents needed to decrypt the payment card numbers, and at this\npoint, Marriott has not been able to rule out the possibility that both\nwere taken. For the remaining guests, the information was limited to\nname and sometimes other data such as mailing address, email\naddress, or other information.\n\nMarriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to\nsupport their investigation. The company is also notifying regulatory\nauthorities.\n\nMarriott deeply regrets this incident happened. From the start, we\nmoved quickly to contain the incident and conduct a thorough\ninvestigation with the assistance of leading security experts. Marriott is\nworking hard to ensure our guests have answers to questions about\ntheir personal information with a dedicated website and call center. We\nare supporting the efforts of law enforcement and working with leading\nsecurity experts to improve. Marriott is also devoting the resources\nnecessary to phase out Starwood systems and accelerate the ongoing\n\n\x0csecurity enhancements to our network.\n\nGuest Support\n\nMarriott has taken the following steps to help you monitor and protect\nyour information:\n\nDedicated Call Center\n\nMarriott has established a dedicated call center to answer questions\nyou may have about this incident. The call center is open seven days a\nweek, and is available in multiple languages. Our dedicated call center\nmay experience high volume initially, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nEmail notification\n\nMarriott began sending emails on a rolling basis on November 30, 2018\nto affected guests whose email addresses are in the Starwood guest\nreservation database.\n\nFree WebWatcher Enrollment\n\nMarriott is providing guests the opportunity to enroll in WebWatcher\nfree of charge for one year. WebWatcher monitors internet sites where\npersonal information is shared and generates an alert to the consumer\nif evidence of the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s personal information is found.

Guests from the United States who complete\nthe WebWatcher enrollment process will also be provided fraud\nconsultation services and reimbursement coverage for free.\n\nThe section below provides additional information on steps you can\ntake.

You also have the right to\nrequest a security freeze.\n\nIf you are a resident of West Virginia, you have the right to ask that\nnationwide consumer reporting agencies place \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alerts\xe2\x80\x9d in your file\nto let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of\nidentity theft, as described below. You also have a right to place a\nsecurity freeze on your credit report, as described below.\n\nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on\nyour credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a\nvictim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that\nan initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you\nhave been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud\nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an\nextended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a\nvictim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An\nextended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You\ncan place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the\nthree national credit reporting agencies.\n\nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known\nas a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new\ncredit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number\nthat is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is\ndesigned to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit\nreport without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential\ncreditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your\ncredit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a\nsecurity freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.\n\nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you\nmust separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit\nreporting company. For information and instructions to place a security\nfreeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses\nbelow:\n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013,\n\n\x0cwww.experian.com\nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA\n19016, www.transunion.com\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348,\nwww.equifax.com\n\nTo request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following\ninformation:\n\n1.

The credit bureaus must also send written\nconfirmation to you within five business days and provide you with a\nunique personal identification number (""PIN"") or password or both that\ncan be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security\nfreeze.\n\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual\naccess to your credit report, or to lift a security freeze for a specified\nperiod of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone\nnumber, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting\nagency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or\novernight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper\nidentification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN\nnumber or password provided to you when you placed the security\nfreeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would\nlike to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want\nthe credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have one\n\n\x0cbusiness day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or\nsecure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your\nrequest by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or\nfor the specified period of time. \n\nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a\ntoll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means maintained by a\ncredit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular,\ncertified, or overnight mail to each of the three credit bureaus and\ninclude proper identification (name, address, and Social Security\nnumber) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you\nplaced the security freeze. The credit bureaus have one business day\nafter receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic\nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to\nremove the security freeze.\n\nFair Credit Reporting Act: You also have rights under the federal Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, which promotes the accuracy, fairness, and\nprivacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. The\nFTC has published a list of the primary rights created by the FCRA\n(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-\nact.pdf), and that article refers individuals seeking more information to\nvisit www.ftc.gov/credit.

You must give your consent for\n\nreports to be provided to employers.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance\n\nyou receive based on information in your credit report.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You may seek damages from violators.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have\n\nadditional rights.\n\nIf You Are A European Union Data Subject, you may contact or\nobtain information from your Data Protection Authority at:\n\n \n\n \n\nAustria: \xc3\x96sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\xc3\xb6rde,\nWickenburggasse 8, 1080 Vienna, +43 1 52 152 0, Email:\ndsb@dsb.gv.at\n\nBelgium: De Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit (GBA), Rue de la\nPresse 35, 1000 Brussels, +32 (0)2 274 48 00, Email:\ncontact@apd-gba.be\n\nBulgaria: Commission for Personal Data Protection (CPDP), 2\nProf. Tsvetan Lazarov Blvd., Sofia 1592, +359 899 877 156,\nEmail: kzld@cpdp.bg\n\nCroatia: Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency (AZOP), Fra\nGrge Martica 14, HR-10 000 Zagreb, +385 (0)1 4609-000,\nEmail: azop@azop.hr\n\nCyprus: Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data\nProtection, Iasonos 1, 1082 Nicosia (office address), P.O.

We take this incident very seriously and are providing you with information \nand access to resources so that you can better protect against the possibility of misuse of your personal information, \nshould you feel it appropriate to do so.\nWhat Happened? On June 11, 2018 Rosenberg & Manente became aware of suspicious activity regarding employees\xe2\x80\x99 \nemail accounts. We immediately began an investigation to confirm the security of our network and to determine the \nnature and scope of this event.

Upon\ndiscovery, we promptly removed the code, which we believe was present on the website since at least March\n2017.  Based on our investigation into this incident, however, we cannot be certain as to when the website was\nfirst  victimized  by  this  attack.    Accordingly,  in  an  abundance  of  caution,  we  are  notifying  all  Sotheby\xc2\x92s  Home\nwebsite  customers  (including  those  who  made  purchases  on  the  Viyet  website)  that  it  is  possible  that  their\ninformation has been accessed by an unauthorized party.  \n\nWhat information was involved?\nThe  code  was  designed  to  target  the  data  you  entered  into  the  payment  information  form  on  the  Sotheby\xc2\x92s\nHome website.  This information would include your name, address, email address, and payment card number,\nexpiration date, and CVV code.\n\nWhat we are doing\nUpon  discovering  the  issue,  we  promptly  removed  the  code  from  the  Sotheby\xc2\x92s  Home  website.

Recently, I became aware of unusual activity in one of my email accounts.  I quickly launched \nan investigation, with the assistance of a third party forensic investigator, to understand the nature and scope of \nthe event, and whether any sensitive data was at risk.  The forensic investigation confirmed that my email account \ncredentials were compromised as part of a phishing incident and my email account was subject to unauthorized \naccess. However, the forensic investigator was unable to confirm what emails in my account were accessed by \nthe unauthorized actor.  I then undertook a lengthy and resource heavy review of the email account to determine \nif it contained any personal information.  Working with the forensic investigator, I determined my email account \ncontained information relating to you.  Although I am unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal \ninformation, I am notifying you in an abundance of caution because your information was present in the impacted \nemail account.

We are writing to inform you about an incident involving one \nof our former third-party vendors, Annex Cloud, that previously provided a service only on our website, and which \nmay involve some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some \nsteps you can take in response.\nAnnex  Cloud  provides  a  service  used  by  websites  that  enables  individuals  to  use  their  user  name  and  password \nfrom other websites, like Facebook and Amazon, to log in to merchants\xe2\x80\x99 websites, including www.francescas.com.  \nAnnex Cloud informed Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s that unauthorized code was detected and has since been removed from the code \nused by Annex Cloud to enable logins. In its report to Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s, Annex Cloud identified time periods between \nDecember 28, 2017 and July 9, 2018 when the unauthorized code was or could have been present. If present, the \nunauthorized code could have captured information entered during the checkout process including name, address, \nemail  address,  Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s  account  password,  payment  card  number,  expiration  date,  and  card  security  code \n(CVV).

Thus, we are notifying you because you entered information during the checkout \nprocess during a time period when it is possible the unauthorized code may have been present.\nIf you have a Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s account, for your security, we recommend that you reset your password.

You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below.\nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if \nyou have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert \nstays on your credit report for seven years.

You have the right to place a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d on your credit report. A security freeze will \nprohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit file without your \nexpress authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from \nbeing approved in your name without your consent.  However, you should be aware that using a \nsecurity freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in \nyour  credit  report  may  delay,  interfere  with,  or  prohibit  the  timely  approval  of  any  subsequent \nrequest or application you make regarding a new loan, mortgage, or any other account involving \nthe extension of credit.   \n \nA security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting \non  behalf  of  the  person  or  entity,  with  which  you  have  an  existing  account  that  requests \ninformation in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account.  Reviewing \nthe account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, \nand account upgrades and enhancements. \n \nTo place a security freeze on your credit file, contact the three nationwide credit bureaus, listed \nbelow.  You will need to provide appropriate proof of your identity to the credit bureau, which will \ninclude your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.  \nAfter  receiving  your  freeze  request,  each  credit  bureau  will  provide  you  with  a  unique  PIN \n(personal identification number) or password.  Keep the PIN or password in a safe place.  You \nwill need it if you choose to lift the freeze. \n \nThe contact information for all three credit bureaus is as follows: \n \nEquifax  \nP.O. Box 105788 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n1-800-349-9960 \nwww.equifax.com  \n \n6.  Consider placing a fraud alert with one of the three nationwide credit bureaus.  You \ncan place an initial fraud alert by contacting one of the three nationwide credit bureaus \nlisted  above.  A  fraud  alert  can  make  it  more  difficult  for  someone  to  get  credit  in  your \nname because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may \ndelay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just \none of the three nationwide credit bureaus listed above. As soon as that bureau processes \nyour fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your \nfile.  \n \nAn initial fraud alert stays in your file for at least one year.  To place this alert, a credit \nbureau will require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include \nyour Social Security number.  If you are the victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an \nextended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. \n \n7.  You have the right to free copies of the information in your file (your \xe2\x80\x9cfile disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d).   \nAn initial fraud alert entitles you to a copy of all the information in your file at each of the three \nnationwide credit bureaus listed above. These additional disclosures may help you detect signs \nof fraud, for example, whether fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name or whether \nsomeone has reported a change in your address. \n \n \n\nTransUnion \nP.O.

99,New York Oncology Hematology ,"b'Appendix A - Notice Letter\n\nRe:  Important Security Notification. Please Read This Entire Letter. \n\nNovember 16, 2018 \n[Recipient Full Name] \n[Street Address] \n[City, State Zip Code] \nDear [Recipient Full Name]: \nNew York Oncology Hematology (NYOH) is committed to protecting the security and \nconfidentiality of our patients\xe2\x80\x99 information. Regrettably, this notice concerns an email phishing \nincident that may have involved some of that information. Phishing is the act of sending an e-mail \nfalsely claiming to be an established legitimate business or personal contact in an attempt to \ndeceive the unsuspecting recipient. \nNYOH determined an unauthorized user may have gained access to several employee email \naccounts through a series of targeted phishing emails earlier this year. Once the phishing intrusion \nwas identified, NYOH\xe2\x80\x99s information technology (IT) vendor stopped the attacks by resetting \npasswords to affected email accounts to immediately terminate access. While we are not aware of \nany actual access to or attempted misuse of protected health information or employee personal \ninformation related to this incident, we are proactively notifying NYOH patients, staff, and \nemployees about the phishing intrusion. \nOn April 20, 2018, a phishing incident occurred through which an unauthorized user gained access \nto 14 employee email accounts \xe2\x80\x93 typically only for a few hours at most. A second incident occurred \nbetween April 21, 2018 and April 27, 2018, when one additional email account became accessible. \nImmediately upon discovery of the incidents, NYOH\xe2\x80\x99s IT vendor, took steps to reset passwords, \nshutting down access to these accounts. \nNYOH was subsequently notified of the suspected unauthorized access by its IT vendor. NYOH \ninitiated its incident response protocol to determine the scope and severity of the phishing attacks. \nNYOH hired an outside forensic firm to conduct a review of the content of the accounts.  \n\nWhen Did This Incident Happen: \n\nWhat Happened: \n\n \n\nNYOH/Albany\n400 Patroon Creek Blvd.\nSuite 1 \nAlbany, NY 12206\n(518) 489-0044\n\nNYOH/AMC\n43 New Scotland Ave.\nMail Code 7\nAlbany, NY 12208\n(518) 262-6696\n\nNYOH/Amsterdam\n1700 Riverfront Center\nAmsterdam, NY 12010\n(518) 843-0020\n\nNYOH/Clifton Park\n3 Crossing Blvd.\nSuite 1\nClifton Park, NY 12065\n(518) 831-4434\n\nPage 1 of 4 \n\nNYOH/Hudson\n69 Prospect Ave.\nHudson, NY 12534\n(518) 822-8484\n\nNYOH/Rexford\n896 Riverview Rd.\nRexford, NY 12148\n(518) 399-4600\n\nNYOH/Troy\n258 Hoosick St. \nSuite 206\nTroy, NY 12180 \n(518) 272-2097\n\n\x0cAppendix A - Notice Letter\n\nWhat Information Was Involved: \n\nWhat Is NYOH Doing To Address This Situation: \n\nOn October 1, 2018, following a thorough analysis of the email accounts affected, the forensic firm \nthat NYOH contracted to assess the impact determined that protected health information and other \npersonal information of patients and employees were contained in some of the email accounts that \nwere affected. The following information may have been contained in the affected email accounts: \nnames, dates of birth, home addresses, email addresses, insurance information, medical \ninformation such as test results, diagnostic codes, account numbers, and service dates. In very \nlimited circumstances, the accounts also contained patient and employee Social Security and \ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s license numbers. However, we have no evidence that the intruder actually accessed or \nmisused any of this information.  \nNYOH is taking precautionary steps to ensure patient safety, privacy, and peace of mind. We want \nto ensure the protection of all of our patients and personnel. Accordingly, we are offering you 12 \nmonths of free identity theft and credit monitoring services through Experian, including Experian\xe2\x80\x99s \nIdentity Restoration assistance and IdentityWorksSM.  \nNYOH has taken additional steps to remediate and enhance the security of our email systems. \nThese include active monitoring of the affected systems, regular password resets, and \nimplementing additional employee security training and email protocols. Finally, we requested \nhelp from and are cooperating with federal law enforcement to investigate the phishing attacks.  \nYou can activate fraud detection tools available through Experian by following the steps below: \n(cid:120) Enroll at the Experian IdentityWorks website: https://www.experianidworks.com/3bcredit\n(cid:120) Provide your engagement number: DB09496 [For all Non-Connecticut Residents]\n(cid:120) Provide your activation code: [Recipient\xe2\x80\x99s Unique Activation Code]\n(cid:120) Ensure that you enroll by: February 28, 2019 (your code will not work after this date)\nIf you have questions about the Experian product or services, need assistance with identity \nrestoration that arose as a result of this incident, or would like an alternative to enrolling in \nExperian IdentityWorks online, please contact Experian\xe2\x80\x99s customer care team at 1-877-753-3334 \nby February 28, 2019.

This letter explains the incident, \nmeasures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.\nOn September 18, 2018, we received information about possible unauthorized access to the servers that run our \nwebsite.

The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in \nyour name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who \ngets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the \ntimely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any \nother account involving the extension of credit. \nPursuant to federal law, you have the right to freeze and unfreeze your credit report free of charge with the three credit \nreporting agencies. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit \nreporting company. \nFor more information, visit the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s identity theft website at www.identitytheft.gov. To place a security freeze on \nyour credit report, you can submit a request on the websites of the three major reporting agencies or send a written \nrequest to each by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below:\n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com   \nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\n\nW2172 v.02 11.13.2018\n\n\x0cIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n\n1.

If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to \n\na law enforcement agency concerning identity theft\n\nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure \nelectronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit \nreport. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide you with \na unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal \nor lifting of the security freeze.\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a \nsecurity freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure \nelectronic system maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or \novernight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security \nnumber) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity \nof those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the \ncredit report available. The credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free \ntelephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security \nfreeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.\nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nsystem maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight \nmail to each of the three credit bureaus and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) \nand the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze.

104,Jennifer Miller Ltd ,"b' \n\n11/12/2018 \n\n \n\nRe: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH \n\n \n\n \n\nWe value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know \n\nabout a data security incident that may involve your personal information. We understand how important your privacy is, and we take the \n\nprotection of your information very seriously. Our company is built on honesty, trust and transparency, which is why we are reaching out \n\npersonally to let you know about what happened and what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to address it.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat Happened? \n\n \n\nOn June 6, 2018, we learned that there was unauthorized access by electronic means to our data by a person or persons whose identities remain \n\nunknown. The unauthorized access occurred sometime between February 1, 2018 and February 15, 2018. The unauthorized access involved the \n\ninsertion of rogue code into our checkout page. The code was designed to capture the name, billing address, phone number, and email address of \n\ncertain customers, as well as their credit card information, and then send that data to a remote endpoint. Although we cannot be sure that any of \n\nyour information was accessed or misappropriated, we are sending you this notice to make you aware of the situation and to provide you with \n\nother helpful information. The customer order dates for potentially compromised information are February 1, 2018, until July 15, 2018. We began \n\nan investigation on June 20, 2018, and fully resolved the unauthorized access on July 15, 2018. From that moment forward, we engaged two \n\nsecurity consulting agencies to perform a full sweep of our infrastructure and to identify affected clients. \n\n \n\nWhat Information Was Involved? \n\n \n\nThe information that was accessed without authorization could have included name, billing address for a credit card, telephone number, email \n\naddress, and credit card information including card number, name on card, issuer, expiration date, and security code. \n\n \n\nWhat Are We Doing? \n\n \n\nWe take our obligation to safeguard your personal information very seriously. Upon learning of the potential unauthorized access, we conducted \n\nan examination of the breach and employed technical measures to help ensure that further breaches do not occur in the future. We are \n\nimplementing vigorous, whitelist-based access controls and password policies, as well as deploying a more robust intrusion detection system. All \n\ncompany technical and operational security has been audited and, where necessary, redesigned. We have also notified the FBI and we intend to \n\nfully cooperate with law enforcement if they determine that further investigation of the situation is warranted. \n\n \n\nWhat You Can Do? \n\n \n\nGiven the nature of the information involved, we recommend that you: \n\nReview and monitor your account statements and order a credit report. Under federal law, all citizens are entitled to one free credit report \n\nannually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies.

A fraud alert helps protect you against an identity thief opening a \n\nnew credit account in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the \n\napplicant may be a victim of identity theft. The merchant can then take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on \n\nyour credit report by calling any of the credit reporting agencies identified above. You may obtain more information about fraud alerts by \n\ncontacting the Federal Trade Commission or the credit reporting agencies identified above. You may also consider placing a credit freeze, also \n\nknown as a security freeze, on your file. A credit freeze, or security freeze, is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit \n\nfile at the credit reporting agencies without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a freeze, which generally range \n\nfrom $5-20. Unlike a fraud alert, you will need to separately place a freeze at each consumer reporting agency. For more information on freezes, \n\nyou may contact either the FTC or the credit reporting agencies identified above. The instructions for placing a freeze differ from state to state, \n\nand the credit reporting agencies can provide more information on the requirements. These agencies may ask you to provide the following in \n\nconnection with any such request: your full name with middle initial, social security number, date of birth, all addresses where you have lived for \n\nthe past five years, a copy of government issued identification, and proof of your current residential address, such as a utility bill. \n\n \n\nYou may also have additional rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other federal or state consumer protections laws. \n\n \n\nAdditional information for residents of Maryland, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Massachusetts: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the Maryland Office of the \n\nAttorney General: \n\n\x0cMaryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division \n\n200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the North Carolina \n\nAttorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office: \n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, Consumer Protection Division \n\n9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-877-5-NO-SCAM, www.ncdoj.gov \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For residents of Rhode Island: You may contact the office of the Attorney General for The \n\nState of Rhode Island: \n\nRhode Island Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office \n\n150 South Main Street Providence, Rhode Island 02903, (401) 274-4400, www.riag.gov \n\nResidents of Rhode Island have the right to file or obtain police reports.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding \nyour credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:\n\nEquifax\nP.O.

If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee \nto place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will \nneed to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

A creditfreeze generally lasts until you lift or remove it, although in some jurisdictions it will expire after seven years.  Thecost to place a credit freeze is typically between $5.00 and $10.00 each time you place a freeze, but may vary byjurisdiction.  Certain jurisdictions may also permit a credit reporting agency to charge you similar fees to lift orremove the freeze.  If you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with avalid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a credit freeze.Credit Lock: Like a credit freeze, a credit lock restricts access to your credit report and prevents anyone fromopening an account until unlocked.  Unlike credit freezes, your credit can typically be unlocked online withoutdelay.  To lock your credit, contact all three credit reporting agencies listed above and complete a credit lockagreement.  The cost of a credit lock varies by agency, which typically charges monthly fees.You may also contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) for further information on fraud alerts, creditfreezes, credit locks, and how to protect yourself from identity theft.

(\xc2\x93ImpactAssets\xc2\x94, \xc2\x93we\xc2\x94, or \xc2\x93us\xc2\x94) to inform you of an incident that\nmay  have  involved  some  of  your  personal  information  held  by  us.  We  take  the  protection  of  your  personal\ninformation seriously, and want to inform you about this incident, what we have done to remediate it, and what\nsteps  you  can  take  to  protect  yourself.  We  deeply  regret  that  this  incident  occurred  and  apologize  for  any\nconcern that it may cause you. We will diligently work to improve our systems and security processes, and will\ncontinue to work to earn your trust and confidence in us.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn or about August 28, 2018, we became the victim of a malicious cyberattack from an unknown third party,\nwhich  compromised  a  single  employee\xc2\x92s  email  account.  The  account  included  emails  that  contained  personal\ninformation.  We  discovered  the  compromise  on  August  29,  2018,  and  promptly  secured  the  account  and\ninvestigated the incident. Our initial investigation indicated only that some phishing emails were sent from the\naccount, but did not reveal any specific compromise of personal information. \n\nWe  then  engaged  a  forensics  firm  to  investigate  the  incident  further.  On  October  1,  2018,  the  investigation\nrevealed that the unauthorized third party had downloaded contents from the compromised email account. As a\nresult,  the  forensics  firm  reviewed  the  emails  stored  in  the  account,  and  provided  us  with  a  list  of  impacted\nindividuals along with the personal information potentially affected.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved?\nThe personal information potentially affected included some combination of the following: first and last names,\nemail addresses, social security numbers and taxpayer ID numbers, government identification numbers, financial\naccount  information  (in  some  cases  with  associated  security  code,  PIN,  or  password),  dates  of  birth,  birth\ncertificates, digital signatures, parents\xc2\x92 legal surnames prior to marriage, and usernames and/or passwords for\nonline  accounts.  As  a  result,  that  information  appears  to  have  been  exposed  to,  and  downloaded  by,  the\nunauthorized third party.\n\n0123456\n\nPlease note that the affected information varied by individual based on what was in the compromised emails.\nNot  every  individual  had  all  of  the  information  listed  above  compromised;  however,  out  of  an  abundance  of\ncaution, we are notifying you because of the potential sensitivity surrounding the compromised information. If\nyou are receiving this letter, we currently believe that one or more of the above data elements about you was\npotentially compromised.\n\nE1603-L01\n\n\x0cWhat We Are Doing.\nWe promptly secured the compromised email account, and are diligently working to investigate this matter.

You should plan ahead and lift a\nfreeze, either completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, with enough advance notice before\nyou apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect.  You should contact a consumer reporting agency and request it to lift\nthe freeze at least three business days before applying.

Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide  copies to creditors to correct your records. \nContact information for the Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW   \nWashington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), \n\n  \nIf you are a resident of Connecticut, Maryland, or North Carolina, you may contact and obtain information from your \nstate attorney general at:  \n  \n\nConnecticut Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 55 Elm Street, Hartford, CT 06106 \nwww.ct.gov/ag, 1-860-808-5318 \n \nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202 \nwww.oag.state.md.us, 1-888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) \n1-410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n\n \n  \n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, www.ncdoj.gov,  \n1-919-716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226 \n\n \nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that \nyou may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on \nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been \na victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for \nseven  years.  You  can  place  a  fraud  alert  on  your  credit  report  by  contacting  any  of  the  three  national  credit  reporting \nagencies. \n \nCredit Freezes:  You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of \ncharge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you \ninitiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without \nyour consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your \ncredit  report  unless  you  temporarily  lift  the  freeze.  Therefore,  using  a  credit  freeze  may  delay  your  ability  to  obtain \ncredit. There is no fee to place or lift a credit freeze.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on \nyour credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from \nstate to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information. \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n \nTo place a security freeze on your credit report, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure \nelectronic  system  maintained  by  the  credit  reporting  agency,  or  by  sending  a  written  request  via  regular,  certified,  or \novernight  mail.

Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years \n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A  legible  photocopy  of  a  government  issued  identification  card  (state  driver's  license  or  ID  card,  military \n\nidentification, etc.) \n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit report. The \ncredit  bureaus  must  also  send  written  confirmation  to  you  within  five  business  days  and  provide  you  with  a  unique \npersonal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of \nthe security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security \nfreeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nsystem maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to \nthe credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN \nnumber  or  password  provided  to  you  when  you  placed  the  security  freeze  as  well  as  the  identity  of  those  entities  or \nindividuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. \nThe credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic \nmeans, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or \nfor the specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic system \nmaintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to each of \nthe  three  credit  bureaus  and  include  proper  identification  (name,  address,  and  Social  Security  number)  and  the  PIN \nnumber or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have one business day after \nreceiving  your  request  by  toll-free  telephone  or  secure  electronic  means,  or  three  business  days  after  receiving  your \nrequest by mail, to remove the security freeze. \n \nFair  Credit  Reporting  Act:  You  also  have  rights  under  the  federal  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  which  promotes  the \naccuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.

The  copy  of  your  report  must  contain  all  the \n\ninformation in your file at the time of your request. \n\n(cid:120)  Each of the nationwide credit reporting companies \xe2\x80\x93 Experian, TransUnion and Equifax \xe2\x80\x93 is required to provide \n\nyou with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. \n\n(cid:120)  You are also entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, like denying your application \nfor credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. \nThe  notice  will  give  you  the  name,  address,  and  phone  number  of  the  credit  reporting  company.  You\xe2\x80\x99re  also \nentitled to one free report a year if you\xe2\x80\x99re unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you\xe2\x80\x99re on \nwelfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity theft. \n\n(cid:120)  You have the right to ask for a credit score.  \n(cid:120)  You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. \n(cid:120)  Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.  \n(cid:120)  Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. \n(cid:120)  Access to your file is limited.

It is recommended that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing \naccount statements and monitoring your credit report for unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit \nreport, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. \nTo order your annual free credit report please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. \nYou can also order your annual free credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form \n(available from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov) to:  \nAnnual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

You must \ncontact each of the credit reporting agencies directly to obtain such additional report(s). \n\nFraud Alert. You may place a fraud alert in your \xef\xac\x81le by calling one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies \nabove. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you before they open any new \naccounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay \nyou when you seek to obtain credit.\n\nSecurity Freeze. You have the ability to place a security freeze on your credit report. \nA security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your \nconsent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may be able to use an online process, an automated \ntelephone line, or a written request to any of the three credit reporting agencies listed above. The following \ninformation must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for \nyour spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suf\xef\xac\x81xes; \n(2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past \xef\xac\x81ve years; \nand (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. \nThe request must also include a copy of a government-issued identi\xef\xac\x81cation card and a copy of a recent utility bill \nor bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing \naddress, and the date of issue. The credit reporting agencies may charge a fee to place a freeze, temporarily lift it or \npermanently remove it. The fee is waived if you are a victim of identity theft and have submitted a valid investigative or \nlaw enforcement report or complaint relating to the identity theft incident to the credit reporting agencies. (You must \nreview your state\xe2\x80\x99s requirement(s) and/or credit bureau requirement(s) for the speci\xef\xac\x81c document(s) to be submitted.)\n\nFor Massachusetts residents: The fee for each placement of a freeze, temporary lift of a freeze, or removal of a \nfreeze is $5.\n\n(cid:39)(cid:70)(cid:69)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1)(cid:53)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:69)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:36)(cid:80)(cid:78)(cid:78)(cid:74)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:74)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:1)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:69)(cid:1)(cid:52)(cid:85)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:34)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:90)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:40)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1)(cid:48)(cid:71)(cid:230)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:15) If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or \nhave reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade \nCommission and/or the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s of\xef\xac\x81ce in your home state.

The purpose of this letter is to update you on the additional steps we\nhave taken to address the incident and to protect you and your information. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nBased on its ongoing forensic investigation, Net32 has discovered that one of Net32\xc2\x92s third-party vendors had its\nlog-in credentials to the Net32 platform misused to improperly access Net32\xc2\x92s order management system\nbetween September 22, 2018, and September 25, 2018.  These credentials appear to have been used to\ngenerate anomalous order activity for old orders placed with that vendor in a way that revealed credit card\ninformation to the user of the vendor\xc2\x92s credentials.  During this four-day period, customers began reporting to\nNet32 increased incidents of what appeared to be fraudulent charges relating to the credit cards used to make\npurchases from this vendor.  After learning of the anomalous order activity and the increased fraud reports,\nNet32 suspended the vendor\xc2\x92s credentials on September 25, 2018.  Net32 also required all vendors to reset\ntheir passwords at this time.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved:\n\nAs we stated in our September 29 notice, we believe that certain personal information relating to Net32 orders\nmay have been exposed, potentially including credit card numbers used to place one vendor\xc2\x92s orders on the\nNet32 platform.  We do not believe any personal information that is not associated with Net32 orders, such as\nsocial security numbers, would have been affected by the breach.\n\n0123456\n\nWhat We Are Doing:\n\nWe have required all vendors to change their credentials and we have implemented new requirements for how\nvendors must treat their credentials.  We are also in the process of changing how customer orders are stored\nand processed so that even if a vendor\xc2\x92s credentials are compromised, this type of improper access to customer\n\nE1419-L01\n\n\x0cpersonal information should not occur.  Additionally, we have partnered with Experian to provide free credit\nmonitoring service to all customers who have found potentially fraudulent charges on their accounts.  In the\nevent you have had such charges, please contact Net32 by emailing support@net32.com or calling\n1-800-517-1997\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\nPlease review the enclosed \xc2\x93Reference Guide\xc2\x94 section included with this letter. This section describes additional\nsteps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission\nregarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit\nfile.\n\nMore Information:\n\nWe sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you.  Should you have\nquestions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at support@net32.com or\n1-800-517-1997 between 6 AM EST and 8 PM EST.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPat Cassidy, DMD, MPH\nCEO, Net32 Inc.\n250 Towne Village Drive\nCary, NC 27513\n\nE1419-L01\n\n\x0cWe encourage you to take the following steps: \n\nReference Guide\n\nOrder Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free\nat 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\xc2\x92s\n(\xc2\x93FTC\xc2\x94) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,\nAtlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit reports only through\nthe website, toll-free number or request form.\n\nWhen you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the\n\xc2\x93inquiries\xc2\x94 section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. Some companies bill under\nnames other than their store or commercial names. The consumer reporting agency will be able to tell you when\nthat is the case. Look in the \xc2\x93personal information\xc2\x94 section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as\nhome address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer\nreporting agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign of\npossible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your report,\nwhether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in\nerror, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate\nconsumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your\nreport with you. If the information cannot be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved.\nInformation that cannot be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff\xc2\x92s office because it\nmay signal criminal activity.\n\nReport Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a payment card account, promptly notify your\nrelevant payment card issuer or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud,\npromptly report the incident to law enforcement or your state Attorney General. If you believe your identity has\nbeen stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these steps: \n\n\xc2\xb7\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\nClose the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened\nfraudulently.

Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others\nthat may require proof of the identity theft crime. \n\nYou can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft\nand how to repair identity theft: \n\nFederal Trade Commission Consumer Response Center \n600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20580 \n1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft/\n\n0123456\n\nE1419-L01\n\n\x0cConsider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing\na fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening\nnew credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the\nmerchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to\ntake steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any\none of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to\nflag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you\nalso may contact the FTC as described above. \n\nEquifax Equifax Credit Information\nServices, Inc. \n1-800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com\nP.O.

You may wish to place a \xc2\x93security freeze\xc2\x94 (also known as a\n\xc2\x93credit freeze\xc2\x94) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your\ncredit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security\nfreeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information on security\nfreezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the FTC as described above. As the\ninstructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three nationwide\nconsumer reporting agencies to find out more information. \n\nThe consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request.

It is required by state law that you are informed of your right\nto obtain a police report if you are a victim of identity theft. \n\nFor residents of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. You also have the right to place a\nsecurity freeze on your credit report by contacting any of the credit bureaus listed at above. A security freeze is\nintended to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a\n\nE1419-L01\n\n\x0csecurity freeze on your credit report, you may be able to use an online process, an automated telephone line or\na written request. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if\nyou are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1)\nfull name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address\nand any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law\nenforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government\nissued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that\neach copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. The consumer\nreporting agency may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze and free if you are a\nvictim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police report\nrelating to the identity theft incident to the consumer reporting agency.\n\nFor residents of Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, and West Virginia.

That  is  why  we  are  contacting  you  and \ninforming you about steps that can be taken to help protect your information.   \n\nWhat  Happened?    On  September  13,  2018,  we  discovered  that  malicious  code  had  been \ninstalled  on  the  Teeter  e-commerce  web  platform.    As  soon  as  we  discovered  the  incident,  we \ntook immediate steps to remove the malicious code and to secure all payment card information.  \nWe  also  launched  an  investigation  and  retained  a  leading  forensics  firm  to  determine  what \nhappened  and  whether  customer  payment  card  information  had  been  accessed  or  acquired \nwithout  authorization.    This  letter  serves  to  inform  you  of  the  incident  and  to  share  with  you \nsteps that you can take to help protect your information. \n\nWhat  Information  Was  Involved?    We  believe  that  the  malware  could  have  comprised \npayment card information belonging to customers who utilized our  e-commerce web platform \nto  purchase  products  from  April  11,  2018  to  September  13,  2018.

Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n \nSecurity Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will \nprevent  new  credit  from  being  opened  in  your  name  without  the  use  of  a  PIN  number  that  is  issued  to  you \nwhen you initiate the freeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your \ncredit report without your consent.  As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability \nto  obtain  credit.  You  must  separately  place  a  security  freeze  on  your  credit  file  with  each  credit  reporting \nagency.    If  you  request  a  security  freeze  from  a  consumer  reporting agency  there  may  be  a  fee  up  to  $10  to \nplace, lift or remove the security freeze.  In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the \nconsumer  reporting  agency  with  information  that  identifies  you  including  your  full  name,  Social  Security \nnumber,  date  of  birth,  current  and  previous  addresses,  a  copy  of  your  state-issued  identification  card,  and  a \nrecent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.   \n \nAdditional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or \nfrom  your  respective  state Attorney  General  about  steps  you  can  take  toward  preventing  identity  theft.

You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities \nand file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to \ncorrect your records. \n\nContact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows: \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580, \n1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft\n\nIf you are a resident of Connecticut, Maryland, or North Carolina you may contact and obtain information from \nyour state attorney general at: \n\nConnecticut Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 55 Elm Street, Hartford, CT 06106, 1-860-808-5318, www.ct.gov/ag\nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us,  \n1-888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) or 410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland)\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, www.ncdoj.gov,  \n1-919-716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226\n\nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report \nif you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert \nstays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the \nthree national credit reporting agencies.\n\nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free \nof charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you \nwhen you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your \ncredit report without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be \nable to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may \ndelay your ability to obtain credit. \n\nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on \nyour credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact \neach of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:\n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com\nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com \nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\n\nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)\n2.  Social Security number\n3.  Date of birth\n\n\x0c4.

If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning identity theft\n\nThe credit reporting agencies have one (1) business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure \nelectronic means, or three (3) business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your \ncredit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide \nyou with a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize \nthe removal or lifting of the security freeze.\n\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security \nfreeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail \nto the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the \nPIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or \nindividuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. \nThe credit reporting agencies have one (1) business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure \nelectronic means, or three (3) business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those \nidentified entities or for the specified period of time.\n\nTo remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic \nmeans maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail \nto each of the three credit bureaus and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and \nthe PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze.

The FTC has published a list of the primary \nrights created by the FCRA (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf), and that article \nrefers individuals seeking more information to visit www.ftc.gov/credit. \n\nThe FTC\xe2\x80\x99s list of FCRA rights includes:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  You have the right to receive a copy of your credit report.

This investigation included working with third party forensic investigators to confirm the \nnature and scope of this incident. Through the investigation, we determined that there was unauthorized access to \nseveral employee email accounts in April 2018. It is believed that this access occurred after the employees received \nphishing emails. On August 13, 2018, the results of the data mining of those accounts was completed and the affected \npopulation was identified. \n\nWhat Information was Involved?

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your \naccount statements and monitoring your free credit reports and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity. \nUnder U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting \nbureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You \nmay also contact the three major credit bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.\n\nFraud Alerts. At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors \nto take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells \ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency \nverifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts \non your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, \nplease contact any one of the agencies listed below:\nExperian \nEquifax \nP.O. Box 2002 \nP.O. Box 105069 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n888-397-3742 \n800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com \nwww.experian.com \n\nTransUnion\nP.O. Box 2000\nChester, PA 19106\n800-680-7289\nwww.transunion.com\n\nSecurity Freeze. You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit \nbureau from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. \nHowever, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent \nthe timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other \nservices. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee \nto place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will need \nto supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

This letter \nexplains the incident, measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.\nOn August  28,  2018,  our  security  team  observed  suspicious  activity  on  our  website.

On  September  10,  2018,  the  investigation \nidentified the potential for unauthorized access to payment card data. Findings from the investigation suggest that \ncertain of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 order information and payment card information, including name, address, payment card \nnumber, expiration date, and card security code (CVV), may have been obtained by an unauthorized third party. We \nbelieve the incident only involved customers who placed or attempted to place orders on our website between August \n14, 2018 and August 28, 2018 or between September 18, 2018 and September 19, 2018.

Purchases made in our stores were not affected by this incident.\nWe  encourage  you  to  closely  review  your  payment  card  statements  for  any  unauthorized  charges.  You  should \nimmediately report any such charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally \nprovide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported. The phone number to \ncall is usually on the back of your payment card.  \nTo date, we have no information that any of your personal information was misused in any way. As a precaution, we have \nsecured the services of Experian to offer you a complimentary one-year membership of Experian\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xae IdentityWorksSM. \nThis product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft services.

A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect youare a possible victim of fraud.  A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit.  Instead, it alerts abusiness that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify youridentity before issuing you credit.  Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for thecredit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name.To place a fraud alert, contact any of the three major credit reporting agencies listed above and request that afraud alert be put on your file.  The agency that you contacted must notify the other two agencies.  A fraud alert isfree and lasts 90 days, but can be renewed.Credit Freeze: A credit freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from aconsumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report until the freeze is lifted.  When a credit freeze is in place, no one\xe2\x80\x94including you\xe2\x80\x94canopen a new account.  As a result, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay,interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages,employment, housing, or other services.To place a credit freeze, contact all three credit reporting agencies listed above and provide the personalinformation required by each agency to place a freeze, which may include:1.Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);2.Social Security Number;3.Date of birth;4.If you have moved in the past five (5) years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;5.Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;\x0c(cid:128)(cid:44)(cid:65)(cid:48)(cid:82)(cid:7)(cid:65)(cid:25)(cid:67)(cid:17)(cid:94)(cid:33)(cid:94)(cid:19)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:84)(cid:43)(cid:70)(cid:43)\n(cid:128)(cid:76)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:82)(cid:41)(cid:119)(cid:29)(cid:38)(cid:67)(cid:76)(cid:6)(cid:29)(cid:27)(cid:61)(cid:51)(cid:116)(cid:17)(cid:50)(cid:86)\n(cid:127)(cid:123)(cid:67)(cid:103)(cid:127)(cid:83)(cid:103)(cid:51)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:95)(cid:107)(cid:55)(cid:107)(cid:35)(cid:59)(cid:15)(cid:107)(cid:119)(cid:43)\n\n03-03-1\n\n6.A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or ID card, militaryidentification, etc.);7.If you are a victim of identity theft, a copy of either a police report, investigative report, or complaint to alaw enforcement agency concerning identity theft; and8.If you are not a victim of identity theft, payment by check, money order, or credit card (Visa, MasterCard,American Express, or Discover only).  Do not send cash through the mail.When you place a credit freeze, you will be provided a PIN to lift temporarily or remove the credit freeze.  A creditfreeze generally lasts until you lift or remove it, although in some jurisdictions it will expire after seven years.  Thecost to place a credit freeze is typically between $5.00 and $10.00 each time you place a freeze, but may vary byjurisdiction.  Certain jurisdictions may also permit a credit reporting agency to charge you similar fees to lift orremove the freeze.  If you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with avalid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a credit freeze.Credit Lock: Like a credit freeze, a credit lock restricts access to your credit report and prevents anyone fromopening an account until unlocked.  Unlike credit freezes, your credit can typically be unlocked online withoutdelay.  To lock your credit, contact all three credit reporting agencies listed above and complete a credit lockagreement.  The cost of a credit lock varies by agency, which typically charges monthly fees.You may also contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) for further information on fraud alerts, creditfreezes, credit locks, and how to protect yourself from identity theft.

On May 30, 2018, I began to receive reports from certain M&S clients of a suspicious email they \nreceived from my M&S email account. I immediately changed my email account password, and M&S began an \ninvestigation to determine what happened with the assistance of an outside computer forensics expert. We learned \nmy M&S email account was logged into by an unknown actor in May of 2018, possibly as the result of an email \nphishing attack. The investigation was not able to determine whether any email messages or file attachments stored \nin my email account were actually viewed by the unknown actor. Because those items could have been subject to \nunauthorized access and include sensitive personal information about my tax clients and other associated individuals, \nM&S is making you aware of this incident in an abundance of caution.\nWhat Information Was Involved? M&S undertook an exhaustive review of the contents of my email account and \nour internal records to determine whether any sensitive personal information was exposed and the individuals to \nwhom that information relates.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding \nyour credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:\n\nV7653 v.02 09.26.2018\n\n\x0cExperian\nP.O.

A security freeze prohibits a credit \nbureau from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. \nHowever, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent \nthe  timely  approval  of  any  requests  you  make  for  new  loans,  credit  mortgages,  employment,  housing,  or  other \nservices. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee \nto place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will \nneed to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

If you detect anysuspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account ismaintained.  You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to properlaw enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d).Copy of Credit Report:  You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reportingagencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or bycompleting an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.  You can also contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:Fraud Alert:  You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.  An initial fraud alert is free and will stayon your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report andrequests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.  To place a fraud alert on your creditreport, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above.  Additional information is available athttp://www.annualcreditreport.com.Security Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will prevent newcredit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze.  Asecurity freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  As a result,using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit.  You must separately place a security freezeon your credit file with each credit reporting agency.  If you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency theremay be a fee up to $10 to place, lift or remove the security freeze.  In order to place a security freeze, you may be required toprovide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Securitynumber, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill,bank statement or insurance statement.Additional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from yourrespective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.  You may report suspectedidentity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.  Residents of Maryland,North Carolina, and Rhode Island can obtain more information from their Attorneys General using the contact informationbelow.You also have certain rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):  These rights include knowing what is in yourfile; disputing incomplete or inaccurate information; and requiring consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate,incomplete, or unverifiable information.

You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can \ntake to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also \ncontact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in \ncase you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal \nTrade Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal  Trade  Commission,  Consumer  Response  Center,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft \n\n  \nIf you are a resident of Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, or West Virginia, you may contact \nand obtain information from your state attorney general at:  \n  \n\nConnecticut  Attorney  General\xe2\x80\x99s  Office,  55  Elm  Street,  Hartford,  CT  06106,  860-808-5318, \nwww.ct.gov/ag \n\n \n\n \n\nMaryland  Attorney  General\xe2\x80\x99s  Office,  200  St.  Paul  Place,  Baltimore,  MD  21202,  \nwww.oag.state.md.us, 888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland), 410-576-6300 (for \ncalls originating outside Maryland) \n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699,  \nwww.ncdoj.gov, 877-566-7226 \n \nWest Virginia Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, State Capitol Complex, Bldg. 1, Room E-26, Charleston, \nWV 25305, www.ago.wv.gov, 800-368-8808 \n\n \nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors \non notice that you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an \ninitial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim \nof identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an \nextended  alert  placed  on  your  credit  report  if  you  have  already  been  a  victim  of  identity  theft  with  the \nappropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You \ncan place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies. \n\n4 \n\n\x0c \n\nCredit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your \ncredit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued \nto  you  when  you  initiate  a  freeze.  A  credit  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from \naccessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other \nthird  parties  will  not  be  able  to  get  access  to  your  credit  report  unless  you  temporarily  lift  the  freeze. \nTherefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to \nplace, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, \ntemporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each \ncredit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file \nat each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state \nto  state,  please  contact  the  three  major  credit  reporting  companies  as  specified  below  to  find  out  more \ninformation. \n\nTo place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major \nreporting agencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below: \n  \n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \n\n \nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you  have lived over the \n\nprior five years \n\n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's  license or ID card, \n\nmilitary identification, etc.) \n\n7.  If  you are a  victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report,  investigative report, or \n\ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning  identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a  security \nfreeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to  you within five (5) \nbusiness days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both \nthat can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the  security freeze. \n  \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you \nmust call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification \n(name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you \nplaced the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive \nyour credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The credit reporting \nagencies  have  three  (3)  business  days  after  receiving  your  request  to  lift  the  security  freeze  for  those \nidentified entities or for the specified period of time. \n  \nTo remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail \nand  include  proper  identification  (name,  address,  and  Social  Security  number)  and  the  PIN  number  or \n\n5 \n\n\x0c \n\npassword provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business \ndays after receiving your request to remove the security freeze. \n \nFair  Credit  Reporting  Act:  You  also  have  rights  under  the  federal  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  which \npromotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. \ncreated \nThe  FTC \nthe  FCRA \nby \n(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf),  and \nthat  article  refers \nindividuals seeking more information to visit www.ftc.gov/credit.

Upon learning of the phishing email incident, we \nimmediately disabled the account and reset all account passwords.  Thereafter we worked with third-party forensic \ninvestigators to determine what happened, and whether sensitive information may have been accessible as a result \nof this incident.  With the assistance of the third-party investigators, we learned that an unauthorized actor gained \naccess to the one TAG employee email account.  Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine which \nemails, if any, were specifically accessed as a result of this incident.  The only confirmed unauthorized activity \nidentified was the use of the account to send phishing emails in an attempt to harvest user credentials.  Since the \ninvestigation was unable to rule out access to any specific email or attachment, we undertook a programmatic and \nmanual review of the contents of the account.      \nAfter a thorough and detailed review of the contents of the accessed account, we subsequently determined that \npersonal and/or protected health information relating to your customers, including their first and last name, and some \ncombination of Social Security number, medical record number, limited treatment information and/or subscriber ID \nwas potentially accessible. A limited number of financial account information was also identified in the review. To \ndate we have no evidence to suggest that the information was subject to actual or attempted misuse as a result of this \nincident.\nWe take the privacy of the information in our care very seriously.  Upon discovering this incident, we have been \nworking diligently with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information was \npotentially accessible to the unauthorized actor.  This has involved a time consuming, programmatic and manual data \nreview process.  This review process is complete and we are notifying you now that we have been able to identify the \nsources of the accessible information. We have also taken steps to further increase our security awareness to reduce \nthe likelihood of a similar event from occurring in the future.  \nThis event may result in the imposition of a legal obligation on the Covered Entity who provided the information \nto  TAG  to  provide  notice  of  this  event  to  the  individuals  whose  information  was  accessible,  to  the  Department \nof  Health  and  Human  Services  as  well  as  certain  state  agencies.    However,  we  are  offering  to  notify  impacted \nindividuals and regulators on your behalf.  In order to notify the impacted individuals and regulators, we are asking \nthat you provide us with your approval within fourteen (14) days of the date of this notice, by email request sent to \nCMeier@thecmigroup.com. Please contact us directly to confirm whether you wish TAG to notify your customers \nand regulators on your behalf.  You can also contact us at this email address to receive a list of potentially affected \nindividuals who are affiliated with your organization.  \n\nV4061 v.05 08.13.2018\n\n\x0cAgain,  we  take  the  security  of  personal  information  in  our  system  very  seriously  and  we  apologize  for  any \ninconvenience or concern this incident may have caused you.

On or about March 28, 2018, we at The Affiliated Group (\xe2\x80\x9cTAG\xe2\x80\x9d), confirmed that an earlier \nphishing email incident in November 2017 involving TAG resulted in unauthorized access to one TAG employee \nemail account.  Upon learning of the phishing email incident, we immediately disabled the account and reset all \naccount passwords.  Thereafter, we worked with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and \nwhether sensitive information may have been accessible.  With the assistance of the investigators, we learned that an \nunauthorized person gained access to the one TAG employee email account.  Unfortunately, the investigation was \nunable to determine which emails, if any, were specifically accessed as a result of this incident.  The only confirmed \nunauthorized activity identified was the use of the account to send phishing emails in an attempt to obtain user \ncredentials.  Since the investigation was unable to rule out access to any specific email or attachment, we undertook \na programmatic and manual review of the contents of the account.\nWhat information was involved?  The thorough review of the account involved a programmatic and manual process \nthat looked at every email and attachment in the account to identify the personal and protected health information \npresent, verify whom the accessible information belonged to, and obtain a last known address to direct the notice \nof the incident.  Through this lengthy and time-consuming process, our investigation determined that your name \nand some combination of protected and/or personal information including, Social Security number, driver\xe2\x80\x99s license \nnumber/state identification number, and financial account or payment card number was potentially accessible in \nattachments contained within the email account.  This information would have been shared with TAG as part of the \ncollection services TAG performs on behalf of certain medical providers and other organizations. We currently have \nno evidence that any of your information was subject to actual or attempted misuse as a result of this incident. \nWhat is TAG doing?  We take the privacy of your information in our possession seriously.  We have taken steps to \nfurther increase our security awareness to reduce the likelihood of a similar event from occurring in the future.  We \nare providing notice of this event to you, which includes access to free credit monitoring services (discussed further \nbelow).

A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from releasing \nany information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization.

If you have been \na victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, \nlift or remove a security freeze.  In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, \nor permanently remove a security freeze.  You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three \nmajor credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files.

On March 28, 2018, we at The Affiliated Group (\xe2\x80\x9cTAG\xe2\x80\x9d), confirmed that an earlier phishing email \nincident in November 2017 involving TAG resulted in unauthorized access to one TAG employee email account. \nUpon learning of the phishing email incident, we immediately disabled the account and reset all account passwords.  \nThereafter, we worked with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and whether sensitive \ninformation may have been accessible. With the assistance of the investigators, we learned that an unauthorized person \ngained access to the one TAG employee email account. Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine \nwhich emails, if any, were specifically accessed as a result of this incident. The only confirmed unauthorized activity \nidentified was the use of the account to send phishing emails in an attempt to obtain user credentials. Since the \ninvestigation was unable to rule out access to any specific email or attachment, we undertook a programmatic and \nmanual review of the contents of the account.      \nWhat  information  was  involved?  After  a  thorough  and  detailed  review  of  the  contents  of  the  accessed \naccount,  our  investigation  determined  that  your  name  and  some  combination  of  protected  and/or  personal  \ninformation\xe2\x80\x94including  Social  Security  number,  medical  record  number,  limited  treatment  information  \nand/or subscriber ID\xe2\x80\x94was potentially accessible in attachments contained within the email account. This information \nwould have been shared with TAG as part of the collection services TAG performs on behalf of certain medical \nproviders and other organizations, such as <<Entity>>. We currently have no evidence that any of your information \nwas subject to actual or attempted misuse as a result of this incident. \nWhat is TAG doing? We take the privacy of your information in our possession seriously. We have taken steps to \nfurther increase our security awareness to reduce the likelihood of a similar event from occurring in the future. We \nare providing notice of this event to you, which includes access to free credit monitoring services (discussed further \nbelow). We also notified your creditor, <<Entity>>, which TAG was acting as collections agent for, and we are \nnotifying certain regulators as required. \n\nV6941 v.02 09.14.2018\n\n\x0cWhat you can do. You can enroll in and receive the free credit monitoring and identity restoration services we are \noffering through TransUnion\xc2\xae. You can also review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information for \nadditional details on how to better protect against potential misuse of your information.\nFor more information.

Note, however, that because it tells \ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency \nverifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud \nalerts on your file.  Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit \nreport, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.\nEquifax\nP.O.

If you have been \na victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, \nlift or remove a security freeze.

141,2018-09-14 Stein Mart Inc. ,"b' \n\n \n\n[first name][last name] \n[address] \n[city][state][zip] \n \nDear [first name][last name]: \n\nStein Mart, Inc. (\xe2\x80\x9cStein Mart\xe2\x80\x9d) values the relationship we have with our customers  and understands the \nimportance of protecting customer information. We are writing to inform you about an incident involving \none  of  our  third-party  vendors,  Annex  Cloud,  that  may  involve  some  of  your  information.  This  notice \nexplains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response. \n \nAnnex  Cloud  provides  a  service  used  by  websites  that  enables  individuals  to  use  their  user  name  and \npassword  from  other  websites,  like  Facebook  and  Amazon,  to  log  in  to  merchants\xe2\x80\x99  websites,  including \nwww.steinmart.com. Annex Cloud recently informed Stein Mart that unauthorized code was added to the \ncode used by Annex Cloud to enable logins. Annex Cloud removed the unauthorized code on July 9, 2018 \nand is conducting an investigation. Upon learning this, we began working with our e-commerce platform \nprovider  and  Annex  Cloud  to  learn  more  about  what  occurred.  Although  the  investigation  is  ongoing, \nAnnex Cloud has identified the following four periods of time when the unauthorized code was present \nand  could  have  captured  information  entered  during  the  checkout  process  by  customers  who  placed  or \nattempted to place orders on our website: May 19, June 1, June 5, and July 8-9, 2018. The information \nentered during the checkout process targeted by the code includes name, address, email address, payment \ncard number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV). We are notifying you because you placed, or \nattempted to place, an order during one of these four time periods.  \n \nWe  encourage  you  to  closely  review  your  payment  card  statements  for  any  unauthorized  charges.  You \nshould  immediately  report  any  such  charges  to  the  bank  that  issued  your  card  because  payment  card \nnetwork  rules  generally  provide  that  cardholders  are  not  responsible  for  unauthorized  charges  that  are \ntimely reported. Information on additional steps you can take can be found on the following pages.   \n \nWe  regret  that  this  incident  occurred  and  apologize  for  any  inconvenience.  To  help  prevent  a  similar \nincident from occurring in the future, we removed the Annex Cloud login feature from our website while \nthe investigation is ongoing.   \n \nIf you have questions, please call 800-334-6915 extension 4357 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST. \n \nSincerely, \n\nD.

You can obtain information from these  sources about steps an individual \ncan take to avoid identity theft as well as information about  fraud alerts and security freezes. You should \nalso contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police \nreport  in  case  you  are asked  to  provide  copies to creditors  to  correct  your  records.  Contact information \nfor the Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal  Trade  Commission,  Consumer  Response  Center,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), \n\n  \nIf  you  are  a  resident  of  Connecticut,  Maryland,  or  North  Carolina,  you  may  contact  and  obtain \ninformation from your state attorney general at:  \n  \n\nConnecticut Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 55 Elm Street, Hartford, CT 06106 \nwww.ct.gov/ag, 1-860-808-5318 \n \nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202 \nwww.oag.state.md.us, 1-888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) \n1-410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n\n \n  \n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, \nwww.ncdoj.gov, 1-919-716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226 \n\n \nIf  you  are  a  resident  of  West  Virginia,  you  have  the  right to ask  that  nationwide consumer reporting \nagencies  place  ""fraud  alerts""  in  your  file  to  let  potential  creditors  and  others  know  that  you  may  be  a \nvictim of identity theft, as described below. You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit \nreport, as described below. \n \nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors \non  notice that  you  may  be  a  victim  of  fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and  an  extended  alert.  You  may  ask  that  an \ninitial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be,  a victim \nof  identity  theft.  An  initial  fraud  alert  stays  on  your  credit  report  for  at  least  90  days.  You  may  have  an \nextended  alert  placed  on  your  credit  report  if  you  have  already  been  a  victim  of  identity  theft  with  the \nappropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can \nplace a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies. \n \nCredit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your \ncredit  file,  so  that  no  new  credit  can  be  opened  in  your  name  without  the  use  of  a  PIN  number  that  is \nissued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors \nfrom  accessing  your  credit  report  without  your  consent.  If  you  place  a  credit  freeze,  potential  creditors \nand other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the \nfreeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur \n\n\x0cfees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of \nplacing,  temporarily  lifting,  and  removing  a  credit  freeze  also  varies  by  state,  generally  $5  to  $20  per \naction at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on \nyour credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze \ndiffer from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to \nfind  out  more  information.  To  place  a  security  freeze  on  your  credit  report,  you  must  send  a  written \nrequest  to  each  of  the  three  major  reporting  agencies  by  regular,  certified,  or  overnight  mail  at  the \naddresses below: \n  \n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \n\n  \nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.

142,2018-09-14 Title Nine ,"b' \n\nC/O GCG \nP.O. Box 10618 \nDublin OH 43017-9218 \n \n[first name][last name] \n[address] \n[city][state][zip] \n\n \n\n \n\nDear [first name][last name]: \n\n \n\nTitle  Nine  values  the  relationship  we  have  with  our  customers  and  understands  the  importance  of  protecting  customer \ninformation. We are writing to inform you about an incident involving one of our third-party vendors, Annex Cloud, that \nmay involve some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps \nyou can take in response. \n \nAnnex Cloud provides a service that enables individuals to use their user name and password from social media and other \nwebsites,  like  Facebook  and  Google,  to  checkout  on  merchants\xe2\x80\x99  websites,  including  www.titlenine.com.  Annex  Cloud \nrecently  informed  Title  Nine  that  unauthorized  code  was  inserted  into  Annex  Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s  systems  that  operate  its  login \napplication.  Annex  Cloud  removed  the  unauthorized  code  on  July  9,  2018  and  is  conducting  an  investigation.  Upon \nlearning this,  we  began  working  with our  e-commerce  platform  provider and  Annex  Cloud  to  determine  the  nature and \nscope  of  the  incident.  Although  the  investigation  is  ongoing,  Annex  Cloud  has  identified  the  following  four  periods  of \ntime when the unauthorized code was present and could have captured information entered during the checkout process by \ncustomers  who  placed  or  attempted  to  place  orders  on  our  website:  May  19,  June  1,  June  5,  and  July  8-9,  2018.  The \ninformation entered during the checkout process that the code may have been accessed includes name, address, payment \ncard number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV). We are notifying you because you placed, or attempted to \nplace, an order during one of these four time periods.  \n \nWe  remind  you  to  remain  vigilant  to  the  possibility  of  fraud  by  reviewing  your  payment  card  statements  for  any \nunauthorized charges. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card \nnetwork rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner. \nThe phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card. Please see the section that follows this notice for \nadditional steps you may take. \n \nWe  regret  that  this  incident  occurred  and  apologize  for  any  inconvenience.  To  help  prevent  a  similar  incident  from \noccurring in the future, Title Nine has removed the Annex Cloud application from its website, and we are continuing to \ntake steps to strengthen the security of our website.  \n \nIf you have questions, please call (877) 308-2283 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific Time. \n \nSincerely, \n\nJohnny Lin \nJohnny Lin  \nPresident \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\x0c \n\nADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE \n\n \nWe recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and \nfree credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once  every \n12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your  annual free credit report, please \nvisit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228.

You \ncan obtain information from these  sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information \nabout  fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities  and file a police \nreport.  Obtain  a  copy  of  the  police  report  in  case  you  are  asked  to  provide  copies  to  creditors  to  correct  your  records. \nContact information for the Federal Trade  Commission is as follows: \n  \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20580, \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) \n\n  \nIf you are a resident of Connecticut, Maryland, or North Carolina, you may contact and obtain information from your \nstate attorney general at:  \n  \n\nConnecticut Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 55 Elm Street, Hartford, CT 06106 \nwww.ct.gov/ag, 1-860-808-5318 \n \nMaryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202 \nwww.oag.state.md.us, 1-888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) \n1-410-576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n\n \n  \n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, www.ncdoj.gov,  \n1-919-716-6400 or toll free at 1-877-566-7226 \n\n \nIf  you  are  a  resident  of  West  Virginia,  you  have  the  right  to  ask  that  nationwide  consumer  reporting  agencies  place \n""fraud alerts"" in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft, as described \nbelow. You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below. \n \nFraud  Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that \nyou  may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on \nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been \na  victim  of  identity  theft with the  appropriate  documentary  proof.  An extended  fraud  alert  stays  on  your  credit report  for \nseven  years.  You  can  place  a  fraud  alert  on  your  credit  report  by  contacting  any  of  the  three  national  credit  reporting \nagencies. \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \nCredit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that \nno  new  credit  can  be  opened  in  your  name  without  the  use  of  a  PIN  number  that  is  issued  to  you  when  you  initiate  a \nfreeze.  A  credit  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from  accessing  your  credit  report  without  your \nconsent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit \nreport  unless  you  temporarily  lift the  freeze. Therefore,  using  a  credit freeze  may  delay  your  ability  to  obtain  credit.  In \naddition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a  credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The \ncost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each \ncredit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit \nreporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the \nthree major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information. To place a security freeze on your \ncredit  report,  you  must  send  a  written  request  to  each  of  the  three  major  reporting  agencies  by  regular,  certified,  or \novernight mail at the addresses below: \n  \n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \n\n  \nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:  \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4.  If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years \n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A  legible  photocopy  of  a  government  issued  identification  card  (state  driver\'s  license  or  ID  card,  military \n\nidentification, etc.) \n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law \n\nenforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\n  \nThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your \ncredit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you \nwith  a  unique  personal  identification  number  (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d)  or  password  or  both  that  can  be  used  by  you  to  authorize  the \nremoval or lifting of the security freeze. \n \nTo  lift the security  freeze in  order  to  allow a  specific  entity  or individual  access  to  your  credit  report,  you must  call  or \nsend a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name, address, and Social \nSecurity  number)  and  the PIN  number  or  password provided to  you  when  you placed the  security  freeze as  well  as  the \nidentity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want \nthe credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to lift \nthe security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time. \n  \nTo  remove  the security  freeze,  you  must  send  a  written  request to  each  of the three  credit  bureaus  by  mail  and  include \nproper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when \nyou placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business days after receiving your request to remove the \nsecurity freeze. \n \nFair  Credit  Reporting  Act:  You  also  have  rights  under  the  federal  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  which  promotes  the \naccuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. The FTC has published a list of \nthe  primary  rights  created  by  the  FCRA  (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf), \nand that article refers individuals seeking more information to visit www.ftc.gov/credit.  \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \nThe FTC\xe2\x80\x99s list of FCRA rights includes: \n \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  You  have  the  right  to  receive  a  copy  of  your  credit  report.

Comp\xc3\xa6s\'s employee benefit plan  (""February\nEmail\'). We understand that PBS launched an investigation into the February  Email and\nretained  a third-party  foiensic  firm to assist in that work. On May  4, 2018, PBS disclosed to\nTauck+,  by letter, the results of their investigation. PBS identified  that, on February 1,2018,  an\nunar\xc2\xa1thorized  actor  accessed  a PBS employee\'s  email account and sent  to certain  other third\nparties  an encrypted  email containing information  relating to participants in Compass\'s\nemployee benefit plan. PBS confirmed that the unauthorized  actor did not open the at\xc3\xbcachments\nto the February  Email,  and that there  was no copying or removing of the attachments  to the\nFebruary  Email,  other than the February  Email itself.\n\nAs a part of their investigation,  PBS further identified  that two additional PBS employee email\naccounts  were  subject to unauthorized  access  dating  back to Jarruary  15, 2018.  On or about  May\n17,2018, PBS informed  Tauck  that the only  Compass  employee  personal information  in the two\naccounts  were the attachmerits to the February  Email. According  to PBS, PBS changed  the\ncredentials  for the accounts  within  hours, thereby terminating  the unauthorized  actor\'s access;\ndeactivated  the link to access  the encrypted  February  Email; instructed  all recipients  of the\nFebruary  Email to securely  delete  the email and attachments; and confirmed the recipients  did\nnot retain,  forward,  or otherwise  misuse  the information.  Based  on PBS\'s  reporting  of their\ninitial investigation, we believed that there was no evidence  that any unauthorized  third-\nparty  accessed  or.acquired  Tauck  enployees\'  penonal information.\n\n* Compass\nnotification and investigation  correspondence  was sent  to Tauck\'\n\nServices\' be\xc3\xbaefits  are under the umbrella of Tauck  Inc\'s bene\xc3\xbbt  plan\' all\n\nPage  1\n\n\x0c2.  May  Email\nOn or around May  24,2018, Tauck  received  an email purporting to be \xc3\xbbom  a PBS employee  and\nattaching  certain  inforination reg\xc3\xa6ding  Compass  employees (\'May Email""). Tauck  imr4ediately\ncontacted PBS  regarding  the legitimacy  of the email, and PBS indicated  it was investigating the\nmatter.  On July 20,2018,  PBS disclosed the initial  results of their investigation  into the May\nEmail. PBS determined  that the May  Email had bee\xc3\xbb  sent  from a 3\'spoofed""  ernail  account, made\nto look like it was coming from a PBS email account, by an unauthorized  third  party. Because\nthe spoofed May Empil did not originate from PBS\'s email atcount, PBS advised it was not\npossible  to confirm  all recipients  ofthe May  Email,  but tliat several  recipients  contacted PBS to\ninquire as to the May  Email\'s legitimacy,  including  Tauck.  PBS confirmed that, of those\nindividuals  for whom PBS could confirm  receipt, none read or saved the May  Email  and all\ndeleted it upon PBS\'s request.\n\nPBS  recently confirmed that the information  contained  in the attachments  to the spoofed May\nEmail were identical  to those  attachments in the February  Email.\n\nBased  on additional  information  reported by PBS  to Tauck on or around August  13, 2018, we\nnow have reason to believe  that the data involved  in the February  Email may have  been  accessed\nor acquired by an unauthorized  third  party. At this time, we have  no evidence to suggest that any\nmisuse has occurred  as a result  of this matter. In order to prevent  and detect misuse of yow\ninformation,  we shongly  encourage  you to take  preventative  measures  outlined in this letter.\n\nWhat Information  Was Involved\n\nThe information  contained  in the attachments  may have  included your and, if applicable,  your\ndependents\',  name, Social  Secur\xc3\xbe  number,  and date of birth. We have no evidence that any\nfinancial  information,  health  insurance policy numbers,  subscriber identification  numbers, or any\nother unique  health  insurer  identifier was at issue in this matter. There was no such information\nin the attachments.\n\nWhat We Are Doing\n\nPBS has reported that in response to this data security  matter it has taken  steps  to further enhance\nits security  ptotocols.

We sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause and are sending this letter to inform \nyou about the steps you can take to help protect your information. \n \nWhat  Happened?    In  June  of  2018,  we  learned  of  a  potential  data  security  incident  involving  the  unauthorized \ninstallation of malware by a third party on our e-commerce web platform.  As soon as we discovered the incident, we took \nimmediate steps to secure payment card information belonging to our customers.  We also launched an investigation and \nretained a leading forensics firm to determine what happened and whether customer payment card information had been \naccessed or acquired without authorization.   \n \nWhat Information Was Involved?  We believe that malware installed on our e-commerce web platform by a third party \ncould have comprised payment card information belonging to customers who purchased products from June 2016 to July \n9, 2018.  The affected information may have included names, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.  \nNo other personal information (for example, Social Security number and/or date of birth) was impacted. \n \nWhat Are We Doing?

We also reported the incident \nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\xe2\x80\x9cFBI\xe2\x80\x9d) and will provide whatever cooperation is necessary to hold the perpetrators \naccountable.  In addition, we reported the matter to the payment card brands in order to help protect your payment card \ninformation and to help prevent fraudulent activity.  We are also providing you with information about steps that you can \ntake to help protect your personal information and are offering you identity monitoring services for twelve (12) months at \nno cost to you.  Finally, we have taken steps to enhance the security of customer information and our e-commerce web \nplatform in order to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.   \n \nWhat You Can Do:  You can follow the recommendations on the following page to protect your personal information.  \nWe  recommend  that  you  review  your  current  and  past  credit  and  debit  card  account  statements  for  discrepancies  or \nunusual  activity.    If  you  see  anything  that  you  do  not  understand  or  that  looks  suspicious,  or  if  you  suspect  that  any \nfraudulent transactions have taken place, you should call the bank that issued the credit or debit card immediately.    \n \nAs an added precaution, we have arranged to have ID Experts help protect your identity for twelve (12) months at no cost \nto  you.    The  services  provided  by  ID  Experts  include  Cyberscan  Dark  Web  Monitoring,  $1,000,000  of  identity  theft \nreimbursement insurance, and unlimited access to the ID Experts team.

Additional  information  is  available  at \nhttp://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n \nSecurity Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will prevent \nnew credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number  that is issued to you when you initiate the \nfreeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  \nAs a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a \nsecurity  freeze  on  your  credit  file  with  each  credit  reporting  agency.    If  you  request  a  security  freeze  from  a  consumer \nreporting  agency  there  may  be  a  fee  up to  $10  to  place,  lift  or  remove  the  security  freeze.    In  order to  place  a security \nfreeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your \nfull name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification \ncard, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.   \n \nAdditional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your \nrespective  state Attorney  General  about  steps  you  can  take  toward  preventing  identity  theft.

For this reason,  we are\ncontacting  you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident and to advise  you about what  we are doing\nto protect you from  fraud and identity  theft.\nWhat Happened  and What Information  was Involved\nOn or about the afternoon  of June I1,2018,  certain  of you were unable to access  files residing in our Windows\nenvironment.\nMembers  of our IT staff investigated  and quickly discovered  that a number of files had been  encrypted  and\nrendered  unreadable. Fortunately, our staff was able to quickly identify the program  executing  the encryption\nand immediately  stop  the process.  The program  was called SamSam,  which  is a type of ransomware.  Further\nanalysis determined  that the attackers accessed  our network through  Remote Desktop  beginning on June 8,\n2018.\nTo their credit, our IT staff and  consultants have been able  to restore a majority  of the data that the attackers  had\nencrypted.  We now have full access  to that information.\nWe have not been  able  to conclude  with certainty whether  the intruders  were able  to gain  access  to the personal\ninformation  stored on our servers.  For your reference,  the subject information  is our employees\'  social  security\nnumbers, passport numbers  and driver\'s license numbers.  In the unlikely event  the intntders did gain access  to\nthis information,  however,  we wanted  you to know what  we are doing  to protect  you and what you can do to\nprotect  yourself  from  fraud and identity  theft.\n\n,""t\' 1ffit\xc3\xa0tt\xc3\xaf;\\:fr3,#\xc3\x86f\n\nl_\'j nethlehem, rA\n\xc3\xac\xc3\xbc00 Maloney  Cir.\nBethleherr,  PA \nPhone  {800}  862-8622\nFax (8CCJ  772-733?\n\n,18015\n\nI  Barcla\xc2\xa1 MD \n\n1315  Gol.Jsboto Rd.\nBorclay,  MD  21607\nPhone  i8001  825\'8331\nFax {800} 331-9387\n\nftMocksville,  NC\n\n346 Belnel  Chr\xc2\xa1rch  Rri.\nh4ocxsville,  NC 2702t\nPhone  (80\xc3\xba) 642-0886\nFax t800i  618-\xc3\xbb620\n\nreeb.com\n\nI  Syracuse, NY\n\nI  Providence, Rl \n19 Bus\xc3\xacnes>  Park Dr. \nSnithliel{\xc3\xac, Rl 02917 \nPhone  (800) 343-57\xc3\xbb3  Phone  i8ll0) 422\'5224\nFax  i800) 388-5979  Fax  t800)  531-7332\n\n7475 Henrv Clay 8lvd.\nLiverpool,  i\\Y 13088\n\n-\n\n\x0cWhat  We Are Doing to Protect You\nAs some of you may know, our IT staff and  consultants  have  been working diligently to protect  your  personal\ninformation.

The FTC  can  be reached  at:\n\nFederal  Trade Comrnission\nConsutner  Response  Center\n600  Pennsylvania Ave, NW\n\nWashington,  DC 20580\n\nI -877-TDTHEFT  (43 8-4338)\n\nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft\n\nFraud Alerts: You can  place fraud alerts  with the three  major  credit bureaus by phone  and also via their websites.  A fraud alert tells\ncreditors  to follow certain procedures,  including contacting  you, before  they open any new accounts  or change  your existing  accounts\'\nFor that reason, placing  a fraud  alert can protect you, but  also  may delay you when you  seek  to obtain credit. The contact  information\nfor all three  credit  bureaus  is below.\nMonitoring:  You should always remain vigilant  and monitor your  accounts  for suspicious  or unusual activity.\nSecurity  Freeze: You also have the right to place a security  freeze  on your  credit report. A security  freeze  is intended  to prevent\ncredit,  loans  and services  from being approved in your  name without  your  consent.  To place  a security  freeze  on your credit  report,\nyou need to make  a request  to each consumer  reporting  agency.  You may make  that request by certified mail, overnight  mail,  or\nregular stamped  mail, or by following  the instructions  found  at the websites listed below.  The following  information tnust  be included\nwhen requesting a security  freeze  (note  that ifyou  are  requesting a credit  report for your spouse, this information must  be provided  for\nhim/her  as well): (l) full name, with middle  initial and  any suffixes; (2) Social Security\nnumber; (3)  date ofbirth;  (4) current address and any previous  addresses  for the past five years;  and (5)  any applicable incident  report\nor complaint  with  a law enforcement agency  or the  Registry  of Motor  Vehicles.  The request  must also  include  a copy of a\ngovernment-issued identification  card  and a copy of a recent  utility bill or bank or insurance  statement.  It is essential  that  each copy be\nlegible,  display  your  name  and current mailing address,  and the  date of issue.

153,2018-08-22 Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen ,"b""TO OUR VALUED GUESTS\n\nWe take the privacy and security of our guests\xe2\x80\x99 personal information very seriously. This notice\nis to inform you that some Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen restaurants have been the victims of\ncyberattacks, which may have resulted in unauthorized access to or acquisition of your\npayment card information. Below you will find more information about the incident and the\nsteps we are taking, as well as the steps you can take, to help protect you and minimize the\nrisk of your payment card information being misused.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nOn August 16, 2018, Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen (a concept acquired by Darden Restaurants\nin 2017) learned that between November 3, 2017 and January 2, 2018, an unauthorized\nperson or persons gained access to the Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen network and were able to\naccess and potentially obtain payment card information used to make purchases in certain\nCheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen restaurants in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,\nDelaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri,\nNebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,\nTexas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nOnce Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen learned of this incident, we engaged a third-party\ncybersecurity firm to investigate. Our current systems and networks were not impacted by this\nincident. The unauthorized access appears to have occurred on a network that was\npermanently disabled and replaced by April 10, 2018. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that there are no\nindications of unauthorized access to the current Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen network and\nsystems.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved\n\nWhile the investigation continues, our current understanding is that the affected personal\ninformation involved payment card information, including payment card numbers.\n\nWhat We Are Doing\n\nWe take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. As noted, this\nincident occurred on a network that was permanently disabled and replaced by April 10, 2018.\nAs an added precaution, we have arranged to have ID Experts\xc2\xae provide identity protection\nservices at no cost to those individuals who may have been affected by the incident. To enroll\nfor the services, please call (888) 258-7280 by November 22, 2018. ID Experts is offering the\nfollowing services: MyIDCare services include 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring,\n\n\x0ca $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed identity theft recovery\nservices. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is\ncompromised.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nEnroll in the identity protection services we are providing. Even if you choose not to enroll, we\nrecommend that you remain vigilant and take steps to protect yourself from identity theft by\nreviewing your account statements and by checking your credit report from one or more of the\nnational credit reporting agencies periodically. You are entitled to obtain a free annual credit\nreport from each of the nationwide credit reporting companies\xe2\x80\x94Equifax, Experian, and\nTransUnion. To do so, please go to www.annualcreditreport.com\n(http://www.annualcreditreport.com) or call 1-877-322-8228. If you notice any suspicious\nactivity, you should promptly report such activity to the proper law enforcement agencies.\n\nWe also recommend that you consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files. Adding a fraud\nalert to your credit report file makes it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name by\nrequiring creditors to follow certain procedures. However, this may also delay your ability to\nobtain credit. No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you, so if\nyou elect to do so, contact one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. The first\nagency that processes your fraud alert will notify the others to do so as well.\n\nYou may also add a security freeze to your credit report file to prohibit a credit reporting\nagency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written\nauthorization. In some cases, agencies may charge a fee to place or remove such a freeze.\n\nEquifax \nConsumer Fraud Division \nP.O.

Look for accounts or creditor\ninquiries that you did not initiate or do not recognize. Look for information, such as home\naddress and Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not\nunderstand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report and\npromptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law\nenforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, or the\nFederal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nYou have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Note, however, that \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit \nwhile the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified \nto place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding \nyour credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:\n\nEquifax\n\nP.O. Box 105069\nAtlanta, GA 30348\n1-800-525-6285\nwww.equifax.com\n\nExperian\n\nP.O. Box 2002\nAllen, TX 75013\n1-888-397-3742\nwww.experian.com\n\nTransUnion\nP.O. Box 2000\nChester, PA 19016\n1-800-680-7289\nwww.transunion.com\n\nSecurity Freeze. You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit \nbureau from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. \nHowever, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent \nthe  timely  approval  of  any  requests  you  make  for  new  loans,  credit  mortgages,  employment,  housing,  or  other \nservices. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee \nto place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will \n\nV4313 v.02 08.14.2018\n\n\x0cneed to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

You may ask that an initial fraud \nalert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An \ninitial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your \ncredit report if  you  have  already  been  a  victim  of  identity  theft  with the  appropriate  documentary  proof.

Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your \nability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze \nlaws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by \nstate, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.

On May 29, 2018, Yoakum became aware of suspicious activity relating to an employee \nemail account. We quickly launched an investigation, working together with a leading computer forensics \nexpert, to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. On or about \nJune 8, 2018, the investigation determined that an unknown individual had access to the email account of \na Yoakum employee between May 23, 2018 and May 29, 2018.  Because we were unable to determine \nwhich email messages may have been opened by the unauthorized individual, we reviewed the entire email \naccount to identify what personal information was stored within it, and determined on July 6, 2018 that \nyour  information  may  have  been  affected.  Although  we  have  no  confirmation  that  your  personal \ninformation was actually viewed or acquired without permission, we are providing you this notification out \nof an abundance of caution because the following types of your information were located in an email \nmessage that may have been viewed: your name and [data elements].   \n\nWhat Are We Doing?  Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. Yoakum has strict \nsecurity measures to protect the information in our possession. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly \ndeactivated the impacted employee email account, changed the email passwords for all employees, and \nnotified our other employees to be on the lookout for suspicious emails. We strive to enhance our security \nmeasures along with ongoing training and education for employees to prevent similar future incidents, as \nwell as additional technical safeguards for employee passwords and email accounts. \n\nWhat Can You Do?  Although we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we \narranged to have Epiq protect your identity for 2 years at no cost to you as an added precaution. Please \nreview the instructions contained in the attached \xe2\x80\x9cSteps You Can Take to Protect Your Information\xe2\x80\x9d to \nenroll in and receive these services.

According to the investigation, the unauthorized access took place \nsometime between April 6 and April 12, 2018.   \n \nWhat Information Was Involved \n \nThe accessed database stored customer personal data including: \n \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Payment information, including credit card numbers, security code and date of card expiration \n\xef\x82\xb7  First and last name  \n\xef\x82\xb7  Mailing address  \n\xef\x82\xb7  Email address \n\xef\x82\xb7  Telephone number \n \n\nThe investigation confirmed that your personal data may have been included in the customer data viewed or taken \nfrom the company\xe2\x80\x99s system.  \n \nWhat We Did and What We Are Doing \n \nIn response, the company quickly pulled its affected systems offline and took other steps to remove the threat to \ncustomer information. The company secured all data in its possession and conducted a thorough investigation of the \nincident, to include contracting with an outside forensics firm to identify the root cause of the incident, the scope of \nthe incident, review Optoma\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation steps, and provide additional recommended remediation steps.

The company has taken steps to address the root cause of this incident and \nimprove its information security practices to better protect against a recurrence of this type of incident in the future. \n \nWhat You Can Do \n \nWe highly recommend you review all credit card statements for activity on any credit cards you may have used on \nthe Optoma store website.

In some cases, fees may apply.  \n \n\nEquifax - 1-888-766-0008 \nP.O. Box 740256 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \nwww.equifax.com \n \nExperian - 1-888-397-3742 \nP.O.

Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19022 \n\n       www.transunion.com  \n\n \n \nUnder state law, a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a \nconsumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on \nyour credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, \ncredit mortgages, employment, housing or other services. \n \nIf you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with a valid police \nreport, it cannot charge you to place, lift or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit reporting \nagency may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security \nfreeze. \n \nTo place a security, freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three \nmajor consumer reporting agencies listed above.   \n \nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n \n1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.); \n2. Social Security Number; \n3. Date of birth; \n4.

A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or ID card, \nmilitary identification, etc.) \n7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, \nor complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft; \n8. If you are not a victim of identity theft, include payment by check, money order, or credit card \n(Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through the mail. \nThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security \n\n\x0cfreeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five \n(5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password, or \nboth that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you \nmust call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper \nidentification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password provided to \nyou when you placed the security freeze as well as the identities of those entities or individuals you would \nlike to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The \ncredit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to lift the security \nfreeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time. \n \nTo remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail \nand include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or \npassword provided to you when you placed the security freeze.

Although we do not have any evidence that any misuse of personal information has occurred as a result of this \nincident, there was an email in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account which contained a list of students who had received student \nloans.  As stated earlier, this list contained the student names, loan amounts, and Social Security numbers.  From our \ninvestigation, it appears that the email containing this information was forwarded by the hacker to a third party email \naddress. \n \n            We take the protection of our students\xe2\x80\x99 information seriously, and we have taken steps to help avoid a similar \nsituation from occurring in the future.  We also want you to read the information contained in this letter to protect your \ninformation from potential misuse not only in response to this notice, but as a general matter, given the unfortunate, but \ngrowing prevalence of identity theft in today\xe2\x80\x99s world.   \n \nComplimentary Credit Monitoring Service \n \n\nAdditionally,  we  have  arranged  for  you  to  enroll,  at  no  cost  to  you,  in  an  online  credit  monitoring  service \n(myTrueIdentity) for one year provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion\xc2\xae one of the three nationwide \ncredit reporting companies.

A fraud alert is a consumer statement added to your credit report.  This statement alerts \ncreditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any \naccounts  in  your  name.    Once  the  fraud  alert  is  added  to  your  credit  report,  all  creditors  should  contact  you  prior  to \nestablishing any account in your name.  An initial fraud alert lasts 90 days.  You may also place a security freeze, or credit \nfreeze, on your credit file which is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being provided in your name without \nconsent.  However, setting a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  In addition, you may incur fees to place, \nlift and/or remove a credit freeze.  Credit freeze laws vary from state to state.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically in an \neffort to identify issues.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please \ncontact any one of the agencies listed below: \n \nEquifax \nP.O.

Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4. \n\nIf you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over \nthe prior five years \n\n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\'s license or ID card, \n\n7. \n\nmilitary identification, etc.) \nIf you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or \ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\nThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a \nsecurity freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you \nwithin five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (""PIN"") or \npassword or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you \nmust call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper \nidentification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to \nyou when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would \n\n\x0clike to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available.

The credit bureaus have three (3) \nbusiness days after receiving your request to remove the security freeze. \n\nIf you are a resident of West Virginia, you also have the right to ask that nationwide consumer \nreporting agencies place ""fraud alerts"" in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may \nbe a victim of identity theft. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your \nname because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability \nto obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer \nreporting agencies. Contact information for each of the three credit reporting agencies is as follows: \n\nEquifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111 \nExperian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742 \nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289 \n\nAs soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place \nfraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial Security \nAlert) stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your \nfile for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to \nprovide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for \nan extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy \nof a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional \ninformation a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information \nabout the identity theft report, visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft/. \n\nYou may also obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit \nis not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to place a security freeze on your \ncredit report pursuant to West Virginia law. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency \nfrom releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval. \n\nThe security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name \nwithout your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five business days \nyou will be provided a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password to use if you choose to \nremove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the distribution of your credit report \nfor a period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the \nconsumer reporting agency and provide all of the following: \n\n1.  The unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password provided by the consumer \n\nreporting agency; \n\n2.  Proper identification to verify your identity; and \n3.  The period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report. \n\nA consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a \ncredit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request. \n\nA security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account relationship \nand a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types \nof account review, collection, fraud control or similar activities. \n\n\x0cIf you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security \nfreeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either \ncompletely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, a few days before actually \napplying for new credit.  \n\n \n\n\x0c'",https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2018/07/19/helly-hansen-notice-of-data-breach-to-consumers/,Vermont

The  investigation  found  indications  that\nunauthorized  persons  had  compromised  the  Blue  Springs  computer  system  and  loaded  a  variety  of\nmalware  programs,  including  the  encryption  program  responsible  for  the  ransomware  attack.

At  this  time,  we  have  not  received  any  indication  that  the  information  has\nbeen used by an unauthorized individual. \n\nIn response to this incident, we have taken steps to strengthen our defenses against similar incidents in\nthe future.  Immediately after discovery of the incident, we engaged a forensic information technology\ncompany to assist with quarantining the affected systems and to install software to monitor whether any\nunauthorized  person  was  accessing  the  system.    We  also  deployed  new  technology  to  prevent  future\nintrusions,  including  a  new  firewall.

If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained.  You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d).  Copy of Credit Report:  You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.  You can also contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:   Equifax P.O. Box 105851 Atlanta, GA 30348 1-800-525-6285 www.equifax.com Experian P.O. Box 9532 Allen, TX 75013 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com TransUnion P.O. Box 1000 Chester, PA 19016 1-877-322-8228 www.transunion.com Free Annual Report P.O. Box 105281 Atlanta, GA 30348 1-877-322-8228 www.annualcreditreport.com  Fraud Alert:  You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.  An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.  To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.  Security Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency.  If you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift or remove the security freeze.  In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.  Additional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.  You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Residents of Maryland, North Carolina, and Rhode Island can obtain more information from their Attorneys General using the contact information below.

As soon as onecredit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file.Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your creditreport, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports.

If you have been a victimof identity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot chargeyou to place, list or remove a security freeze.  In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge youa fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze.  You will need to placea security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wishto place a freeze on all of your credit files.

(\xe2\x80\x9cFruitful Yield\xe2\x80\x9d) e-commerce \nwebsites:  \n\nFruitfulYield.com \nNOW-2-U.com \nVitaminExperts.com\n\nJust because you made a purchase during this timeframe on one of these websites does not mean you are a victim \nof fraud. We encourage you to review the information in this letter for some steps that you can take to protect yourself \nagainst the potential misuse of your information. \n\nWhat Happened?\n\nIt recently came to our attention that during the time period from May 29, 2018 to June 13, 2018, an unauthorized \nuser gained access to the affected sites through a third party vendor\xe2\x80\x99s extension, and may have acquired certain \ninformation about our customers. \n\nWe value your business and respect the privacy of your information, and take this matter very seriously. We began \ninvestigating the incident as soon as we became aware of unusual activity and took immediate action, including \nworking with our security consultant, conducting an investigation into this matter, and reporting it to the third party \nvendor, who was previously unaware of the vulnerability with its extension. \n\nWhat Information Was Involved?\n\nThe personal information potentially exposed included:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Customer name and address\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Credit card number, expiration date and CVV\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Customer username and password for the website\n\nWhat Are We Doing?\n\nIn addition to the steps noted above, we have taken steps to remediate the incident and prevent similar incidents \nfrom occurring in the future. Specifically, we have identified and patched the point-of-entry, conducted an in-depth \nreview of server logs, created and deployed security patches, set-up and conducted nightly in-depth security \nscans for malware, and removed all files and script references uploaded by the unauthorized user, and updated our \nprioritization of security patches to address issues relating to this vendor and our e-commerce websites. \n\n??????-????\n\n\x0cTo help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to \nprovide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and \ntheir team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential \ndata. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Web Watcher, Public Persona, Quick Cash \nScan, $1 Million Identity Fraud Loss Reimbursement, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration. For more \ninformation about the services and how to enroll, please see the attachment to this letter.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nWhile we will continue to take steps to improve our security, there are also some steps that you can take to help \nprotect yourself, such as:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Regularly Review Your Financial Statements. We recommend you remain vigilant by regularly reviewing your \n\ncredit card and bank account statements. This is the most important step that you can take to detect and \nprevent any unauthorized use of your credit card number.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Contacting Your Credit Card Issuer. We are taking steps to notify the various credit card companies about \nthis breach. We ask that you remain vigilant by carefully reviewing your credit card account statements and \nimmediately alerting your credit card issuing bank of any suspicious charges. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Changing Your Passwords. Fruitful Yield does not store plain text passwords in its database, but it is possible \n\nthat the unauthorized user had access to passwords in plain text before they got to our database. Thus, you \nshould immediately change your password for any or all of the above-mentioned websites. Additionally, we \nhighly recommend customers who utilize similar credentials across other platforms reset any passwords on \naccounts that may use the same or a similar login password. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Obtain a Free Credit Report. You may request a free copy of your U.S. credit report once every 12 months by \n\nvisiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 1-877-322-8228 toll free. You can print a copy of the request \nform at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/rights.shtm. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Carefully Review Your Credit Report. Carefully review any credit reports you receive. Look for accounts you did \nnot open. Look for inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate. Also, look for personal information, such as \nhome address and Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call \nthe credit agency at the telephone number on the report. We also suggest that you consider contacting one of \nthe major credit bureaus listed below to place a fraud alert on your credit reports:\nEquifax: 800 525-6285; www.equifax.com; P.O. Box 740231, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241\nExperian: 888 397-3742; www.experian.com; P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013;\nTransUnion: 800 680-7289; www.transunion.com; Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your \naccount statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Under U.S. \nlaw, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order \nyour free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the \nthree major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.\n\nFraud Alerts. At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors \nto take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells \ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency \nverifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts \non your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, \nplease contact any one of the agencies listed below:\nExperian \nEquifax \nP.O. Box 105069 \nP.O. Box 2002 \nAllen, TX 75013 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n888-397-3742 \n800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com \nwww.experian.com \n\nTransUnion\nP.O. Box 2000\nChester, PA 19106\n800-680-7289\nwww.transunion.com\n\nSecurity Freeze. You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau \nfrom releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. However, \nplease be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely \napproval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. If you \nhave been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you \nto place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily \nlift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly range from $3 to \n$15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you \nwish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will need to supply your full \nname, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to five previous years, \nemail address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility bill, bank or insurance \nstatement, or other statement proving residence.

The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within 5 business days \nand provide you  a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password, or  both that can be used by you to authorize the \nremoval  or  lifting  of  the  security  freeze.

We are writing \nto notify you about a security incident that may have involved your information. This notice explains the incident, \nmeasures we have taken, and some additional steps you can take in response to help protect your information. \n\nWhat Happened \n\nAn outside security firm recently advised us that a database we use to record call information was accessible over the \ninternet. Upon learning of this, we immediately initiated an internal review and reconfigured and restricted external \naccess to the information. We also hired a leading computer security firm to help determine how this happened and \nthe extent of the incident. \n\nOur  investigation  determined  that  the  incident  was  caused  by  an  employee  who  inadvertently  misconfigured  the \nsettings during a recent upgrade, which caused a database file to be accessible from the internet. Our investigation \nalso confirmed that the only unauthorized access was by the security firm who initially reported this incident to us, \nwhich access took place between March 14 and April 23, 2018. The security firm has assured us that all copies of the \ndata have been destroyed. Based on our investigation to date, we have no evidence of any misuse of your information. \n\nWhat Information Was Involved \n\nThe database contained information related to a call to 211 LA County that included your name and Social  Security \nnumber provided during the course of the phone call. \n\nWhat We Are Doing \n\nTo  help  prevent  a  similar  incident  from  happening  in  the  future,  211  LA  County  reconfigured  processes  and \nprocedures  so  that  this  information  is  no  longer  accessible  from  the  internet  and  added  additional  security  to  our \ninternet-based storage platforms. We also are providing additional and ongoing staff data security training, reviewing \nexisting  security  and  privacy  policies,  and  enhanced  the  security  protections  we  already  have  in  place.\n\nV831 v.02 07.03.2018 \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat You Can Do \n\nEven though we have no evidence of any misuse of your information, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering \nyou  a  complimentary  one-year  membership  to  Experian\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xae  IdentityWorksSM  Credit  3B.

Personal information affected by the incident includes payment card information (card number, \nsecurity  code,  and  expiration  date),  first  and  last  name,  middle  initial,  address,  city,  state,  and  ZIP  code.  Only  \none-time payments were affected, whether made by manually entering your information at the time of payment or by \nusing information stored in your Wallet to make the one-time payment. \nOur records indicate that you may have used the Click2Gov online-payment system to make a one-time utilities \npayment during the time noted above. \nThe Village of Wellington values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. We have implemented \nadditional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack, and to protect your privacy.

A security freeze may delay, interfere \nwith,  or  prevent  the  timely  approval  of  any  requests  you  make  for  new  loans,  credit  mortgages, \nemployment, housing, or other services. A security freeze will need to be obtained separately from each  \ncredit-reporting agency. You must contact each credit agency separately to order a security freeze.

195,Macy’s ,"b' \n\n \n\nATTACHMENT 1: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH \n\nJune 27, 2018 \n\n \nOn behalf of macys.com, we are writing to inform you about a recent incident involving unauthorized access to personal \ninformation about you. We regret that this incident occurred and appreciate your time to read this letter.  \n \nWHAT HAPPENED?  \nOn June 11, 2018, our cyberthreat alert tools detected suspicious login activities related to certain macys.com \ncustomer online profiles using valid usernames and passwords. We immediately began an investigation. Based on \nour investigation, we believe that an unauthorized third party, from approximately April 26, 2018 through June 12, \n2018, used valid customer user names and passwords to login to customer online profiles. We believe the third \nparty obtained these customer usernames and passwords from a source other than Macy\xe2\x80\x99s. \n \nOn June 12, we blocked profiles with suspicious logins. A customer\xe2\x80\x99s profile will remain blocked until the customer \nupdates the password associated with the profile. You should have received an email notifying you that your \nprofile was blocked for security purposes. If you did not receive the email, please see the section below entitled \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I did not get an email notice?\xe2\x80\x9d  \n \nThe following provides additional information relating to this unfortunate event, including consumer protection \noptions available to you. Please be aware that Macy\xe2\x80\x99s will never ask you for your profile password. \n \nWHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED? \nAfter logging into a macys.com online profile, the unauthorized party was able to access the following information \navailable in the profile: First and Last Name; Full Address; Phone Number; Email Address; Birthday (Month & Day \nonly) and Debit or Credit Card Number with expiration dates.  \n \nMacys.com online profiles do not include Credit Verification Values (CVV) or Social Security numbers.  As a result, \nthis information was not accessed. \n \nWHAT ARE WE DOING? \nAs discussed above, we immediately began an investigation as soon as we discovered the suspicious login activity.  \nWe have blocked profiles where we believe there was suspicious login activity. We have reported relevant debit \nand credit card numbers to Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We have also added additional \nsecurity rules around website login.  \n \nAs discussed below, we are also making certain AllClear ID identity protection services available to you, at no cost \nto you. \n \nWHAT CAN YOU DO? \nYou should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account \nstatements and monitoring credit reports. You may also contact your credit or debit card company and inform \nthem that your card information may have been compromised. Your bank or credit card provider can suggest \nappropriate steps to protect your account. You should review your bank and card statements regularly, and \nimmediately report any suspicious activity to your bank or credit card provider. Payment card rules generally provide \nthat cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.  \n \nBecause we believe that the unauthorized third party used your valid username and password to login to your \nprofile and the third party obtained your credentials from a source other than Macy\xe2\x80\x99s, we strongly encourage you \nto change your password for any online account for which you used the same username and password.  In \naddition, it is always a good idea to ensure passwords to your online accounts are unique, changed regularly and \nthat the same or similar passwords are not reused.  \n\n\x0c \n \nWHAT IF I DID NOT GET AN EMAIL NOTICE? \nIf you did not receive an email with the subject line \xe2\x80\x9cImportant information about your Macy\xe2\x80\x99s online profile,\xe2\x80\x9d please \ncheck your junk mail folder. If you cannot locate the email, please know that your macys.com profile is blocked, and you \nwill not be able to login until you change your password. We encourage you to change your password to a unique \npassword that you do not use at another website.   \n \nCUSTOMER PROTECTION \nWe at macys.com value our customer relationship, appreciate your business and would like to provide as much \nassistance as we can. Therefore, as an added precaution, we have arranged to have AllClear ID (www.allclearid.com) \nprovide you with identity protection services for 12 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services \nstart on the date of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 12 months.  \n  \n\nAllClear Identity Repair: This service is automatically available to you with no enrollment required. If a problem \narises, simply call 1-855-861-4018 and a dedicated investigator will help recover financial losses, restore your \ncredit and make sure your identity is returned to its proper condition. \n  \nAllClear  Identity  Theft  Monitoring:  This  service  offers  additional  layers  of  protection  including  identity  theft \nmonitoring that delivers secure, actionable alerts to you by phone, as well as $1 million identity theft insurance \ncoverage.

For further information about your rights under the FCRA, please visit:  \nhttp://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201410_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf. \n \nYou may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security \nfreezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can \nmake it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to \nprotect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one  \n\n\x0c \n \nof the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will \nnotify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.  In addition, you can contact the \nnationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict access to your credit \nreport: \n\n(1)  Equifax \xe2\x80\x93 (800) 349-9960 \n(2)  Experian \xe2\x80\x93 (888) 397-3742 \n(3)  TransUnion \xe2\x80\x93 (888) 909-8872 \n\nYou will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information.  The \nfee to place a credit freeze varies based on where you live.  After receiving your request, each credit reporting agency \nwill send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need to lift or remove the freeze.  \nYou should keep the PIN or password in a safe place. \n \nFOR MORE INFORMATION \nWe regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you.

On February \n1, 2018, a CAIS employee received an email from the compromised account at the trusted vendor \nwhich  appeared  legitimate,  thereby  deceiving  the  CAIS  employee  and  compromising  the  email \naccount of such CAIS employee. Based on our forensic review of the incident, we believe that the \nattacker was able to access this employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account on February 19 via a web interface, as \nwell  as  download  email  via  an  email  client.  The  compromised  email  account  was  detected  on \nFebruary 22 by the CAIS Security Team.  \n \nUpon detection of the compromised email account, the following plan was put into action: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The password on the compromised email account was changed immediately by the CAIS \n\nSecurity Team. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Microsoft Office 365 Support was engaged immediately by the CAIS Security Team to \n\nassist in gathering details of the attack and to contain any further activity. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Counsel and forensic experts at Navigant were retained to comprehensively understand \n\nthe scope of the intrusion. \n\n\x0c \n \n \n \n \n    \n\n \n\n527 MADISON AVE., 2nd FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10022    +1 212 300 9350    CAISGROUP.COM  \n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  CAIS has implemented two factor authentication for all employee email accounts to \n\nfurther safeguard against these types of exploits, among other new policies and \nprocedures. \n\n \nData security is of paramount importance to CAIS. Our information security policies and practices \nmeet  and  exceed  those  best  practices  and  guidelines  recommended  for  the  wealth  management \nindustry. All CAIS personnel receive thorough annual security training including the identification \nand  avoidance  of  phishing  attacks,  however,  regrettably,  the  human  element  is  not  perfect  and \nhence  remains  the  weakest  link  in  any  security  program.  Industry  analysis  reports  of  phishing \nattempts in 2018 suggest the volume of phishing attacks has grown 65% in the last year and that \n76% of businesses reported being a victim of a phishing attack in the last year. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved? \n \nIt  has  been  determined  that  the  compromised  email  account  contained  certain  elements  of  your \nPersonally Identifiable Information.   We should emphasize that while the CAIS employee\xe2\x80\x99s email \naccount was compromised, we have no evidence confirming that the unauthorized individual has \naccessed  any  messages  containing  Personally  Identifiable  Information.    For  purposes  of  this \ncommunication, \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally Identifiable Information\xe2\x80\x9d includes individual names, tax identification \nnumbers, social security numbers, postal addresses and email addresses. \n \nWhat We Are Doing. \n \nUpon  discovery  of  the  incident,  we  blocked  the  intruder\xe2\x80\x99s  access  and  conducted  a  forensic \ninvestigation. We are offering all affected individuals credit monitoring services at no charge. We \nhave arranged to have AllClear ID protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you.

CAIS  initially  provided  notice  to  known  affected  individuals  and  the  relevant  state \nregulators on March 22, 2018. Since then, CAIS continued its investigation and learned additional \ninformation about the scope of the incident.  \n\nThe incident stems from one CAIS employee being the victim of an email phishing attack. The \nphishing attack appears to have taken place on or about February 1, 2018. Upon discovering this \nincident on March 15, 2018, CAIS conducted a forensic investigation and confirmed that no other \ncompany  systems  were  affected.  The  phishing  attack  compromised  a  single  Office  365  email \naccount and did not compromise the integrity of the CAIS platform.  \n\nThrough further investigation, CAIS has now identified approximately 11 Vermont residents who \nmay have had their personal information available through the affected account. On June 22, 2018, \nCAIS began notifying these individuals. In total, approximately 2,321 individuals were determined \nto be potentially affected by this incident. As a precautionary measure, CAIS is also providing one \nyear of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to potentially affected individuals \nthrough AllClear ID, as described in the attached sample notice letter. \n\nAt  this  time,  there  continues  to  be  no  indication  of  financial  fraud  with  any  CAIS  accounts. \nHowever, information that may have been available through the impacted employee credentials \nincludes  employee  names,  contact  information,  tax  identification  numbers,  financial  account \ninformation, and other information connected with CAIS financial services. \n\nSidley Austin (DC) LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership doing business as Sidley Austin LLP and practicing in affiliation with other Sidley Austin partnerships. \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\n \nCAIS will continue to provide regular reminders and annual training for employees on how to spot \nand avoid being victimized by phishing emails in the future.

On February \n1, 2018, a CAIS employee received an email from the compromised account at the trusted vendor \nwhich appeared legitimate, thereby deceiving the CAIS employee and compromising the email \naccount of such CAIS employee. Based on our forensic review of the incident, we believe that the \nattacker was able to access this employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account on February 19 via a web interface, as \nwell as  download  email  via  an  email  client. The  compromised  email  account was  detected  on \nFebruary 22 by the CAIS Security Team.  \n \nUpon detection of the compromised email account, the following plan was put into action: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The password on the compromised email account was changed immediately by the CAIS \n\nSecurity Team. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Microsoft Office 365 Support was engaged immediately by the CAIS Security Team to \n\nassist in gathering details of the attack and to contain any further activity. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Counsel and forensic experts at Navigant were retained to comprehensively understand \n\nthe scope of the intrusion. \n\n\x0c \n \n \n \n \n    \n\n \n\n527 MADISON AVE., 2nd FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10022    +1 212 300 9350    CAISGROUP.COM  \n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  CAIS has implemented several new policies, procedures and security measures with \nrespect to email access and handling of personally identifiable information in order to \nprevent any further exploits of this nature. \n\n \nData security is of paramount importance to CAIS. Our information security policies and practices \nmeet and exceed those best practices and guidelines recommended for the wealth management \nindustry. All CAIS personnel receive thorough annual security training including the identification \nand avoidance of phishing attacks, however, regrettably, the human element is not perfect and \nhence  remains  the  weakest  link  in  any  security  program.  Industry  analysis  reports  of  phishing \nattempts in 2018 suggest the volume of phishing attacks has grown 65% in the last year and that \n76% of businesses reported being a victim of a phishing attack in the last year. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved? \n \nIt has been determined that the compromised email account contained certain elements of your \nPersonally Identifiable Information.   We should emphasize that while the CAIS employee\xe2\x80\x99s email \naccount was compromised, we have no evidence confirming that the unauthorized individual has \naccessed  any  messages  containing  Personally  Identifiable  Information.    For  purposes  of  this \ncommunication, \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally Identifiable Information\xe2\x80\x9d includes individual names, tax identification \nnumbers, social security numbers, postal addresses and email addresses. \n \nWhat We Are Doing. \n \nUpon  discovery  of  the  incident,  we  blocked  the  intruder\xe2\x80\x99s  access  and  conducted  a  forensic \ninvestigation.

NCCSD provides\nthis coverage as an employee benefit to active employees and makes it available for purchase to some qualifying\nretirees at our group rate. NCCSD developed a request for quotation package so that we could provide this\ninformation to potential insurance brokers interested in quoting the coverage. As a matter of routine, all bids,\nrequests for proposals and requests for quotes are posted to the NCCSD webpage under the District\nService/Purchasing heading. This request for quotation package was posted there as well.\n\nOn June 6, 2o18, NCCSD became aware that page 27 of our 28 page quotation package posted to the website\ncontained the names, dates of birth and social security numbers of some of our retirees who have been purchasing\nthis coverage. The information was posted to the website from March 26, 2018 until at least May4, 2018.

A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your\nconsent. Ifyou place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your\ncredit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain\ncredit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to\nstate. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per\naction at each credit reporting company. Unlike af/\'aud alert, you must separately place a creditfreeze on your credit\nfile at each credit reporting company.Since the instructions for how to establish a creditfreezediffer from state to\nstate, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:\n\nEquifax:\nExperian:\nTra11sUIu\'on LLC:\n\nP.O.

On February \n1, 2018, a CAIS employee received an email from the compromised account at the trusted vendor \nwhich appeared legitimate, thereby deceiving the CAIS employee and compromising the email \naccount of such CAIS employee. Based on our forensic review of the incident, we believe that the \nattacker was able to access this employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account on February 19 via a web interface, as \nwell as  download  email  via  an  email  client. The  compromised  email  account was  detected  on \nFebruary 22 by the CAIS Security Team.  \n \nUpon detection of the compromised email account, the following plan was put into action: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The password on the compromised email account was changed immediately by the CAIS \n\nSecurity Team. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Microsoft Office 365 Support was engaged immediately by the CAIS Security Team to \n\nassist in gathering details of the attack and to contain any further activity. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Counsel and forensic experts at Navigant were retained to comprehensively understand \n\nthe scope of the intrusion. \n\n\x0c \n \n \n \n \n    \n\n \n\n527 MADISON AVE., 2nd FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10022    +1 212 300 9350    CAISGROUP.COM  \n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  CAIS has implemented several new policies, procedures and security measures with \nrespect to email access and handling of personally identifiable information in order to \nprevent any further exploits of this nature. \n\n \nData security is of paramount importance to CAIS. Our information security policies and practices \nmeet and exceed those best practices and guidelines recommended for the wealth management \nindustry. All CAIS personnel receive thorough annual security training including the identification \nand avoidance of phishing attacks, however, regrettably, the human element is not perfect and \nhence  remains  the  weakest  link  in  any  security  program.  Industry  analysis  reports  of  phishing \nattempts in 2018 suggest the volume of phishing attacks has grown 65% in the last year and that \n76% of businesses reported being a victim of a phishing attack in the last year. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved? \n \nIt has been determined that the compromised email account contained certain elements of your \nPersonally Identifiable Information.   We should emphasize that while the CAIS employee\xe2\x80\x99s email \naccount was compromised, we have no evidence confirming that the unauthorized individual has \naccessed  any  messages  containing  Personally  Identifiable  Information.    For  purposes  of  this \ncommunication, \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally Identifiable Information\xe2\x80\x9d includes individual names, tax identification \nnumbers, social security numbers, postal addresses and email addresses. \n \nWhat We Are Doing. \n \nUpon  discovery  of  the  incident,  we  blocked  the  intruder\xe2\x80\x99s  access  and  conducted  a  forensic \ninvestigation. We are offering all affected individuals credit monitoring services at no charge. We \nhave arranged to have AllClear ID protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you.

HealthEquity,  Inc.  (\xe2\x80\x9cHealthEquity\xe2\x80\x9d)  manages \nthese  accounts  for  your  employer.  This  incident  only  affects  the  systems  of  HealthEquity,  not  those  of  your  employer. \nThis  letter  provides  you  with  information  concerning  the  incident  as  well  as  detailed  information  about  steps  we  have \ntaken to mitigate the effects of this incident. \n \nWhat Happened \nOn  April  11,  2018,  an  unauthorized  individual  gained  access  to  one  email  account  for  a  HealthEquity  employee.  The \nindividual  used  his  access to  send  phishing  emails  from  that  account to  numerous  individuals.  HealthEquity  discovered \nthe unauthorized access on April 13, 2018, and excluded the individual from the email account. However, during the time \nthat the individual had access to the account it is possible, but we cannot confirm, that the contents of the mailbox may \nhave  been  downloaded.  Unfortunately,  the  email  account  contained  a  spreadsheet  attachment  that  included  personal \ninformation about you.   \n \nWe  sincerely  apologize  for  what  happened,  and  we  remain  committed  to  protecting  the  security  and  confidentiality  of \nyour information. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved \nIt is not clear whether your information was used for any inappropriate purposes.

Your \nemployer's name was contained in the email to which the spreadsheet was attached.  \n \nWhat We Are Doing \nHealthEquity  immediately  launched  an  investigation  and  secured  the  employee\xe2\x80\x99s  email  account  to  prevent  further \nexposure.  HealthEquity  is  adopting  new  security  practices  to  prevent  a  similar  incident  from  occurring  in  the  future, \nincluding the implementation of technical security measures and retraining and reeducation of its workforce.  In addition, \nwe  are  offering  identity  theft  protection  services  through  ID  Experts\xc2\xae,  a  data  breach  and  recovery  services  expert,  to \nprovide  you  with  MyIDCare\xe2\x84\xa2.

For more information \nabout the FCRA, please visit https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. You may also \ncontact one or more of the three national consumer reporting agencies listed below.  \n\nFraud Alerts and Security Freezes \nAt no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors to take additional \nsteps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow \ncertain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As \nsoon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you \nwish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the \ncredit reporting agencies listed below. \n\nYou may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from releasing any \ninformation from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. However, please be advised \nthat placing a security freeze may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new \nloans,  credit  mortgages,  employment,  housing,  or  other  services.  If  you  have  been  a  victim  of  identity  theft  and  you \nprovide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all \nother cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees \nvary based on where you live, but commonly range from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately \nwith each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. To request \na security freeze, you will need to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, \nall addresses for up to five previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a \ncopy of a utility bill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.  \n\nTo find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information: \n\nEquifax Security Freeze \n\nExperian Security Freeze \n\nP.O.

HealthEquity is a subcontractor for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of NC \n(Blue Cross NC), which serves as the third party administrator for the State Health Plan. HealthEquity \nadministered the HRA for members enrolled in the Consumer-Directed Health Plan (CDHP). The CDHP \nis no longer offered to Plan members, however, records are maintained by HealthEquity. This incident \nonly affects one email account of one HealthEquity employee, not those of any other State Health Plan \nvendor. This letter provides you with information concerning the incident, as well as detailed information \nabout steps we have taken to address this incident and its impact to you. \n\nWhat Happened\nOn April 11, 2018, an unauthorized individual gained access to one email account for a HealthEquity \nemployee. HealthEquity discovered the unauthorized access on the morning of April 13, 2018, and \nblocked the unauthorized individual\xe2\x80\x99s access to the email account. However, during the time that the \nunauthorized individual had access to the email account it is possible, but we cannot confirm, that the \ncontents of the mailbox may have been downloaded. A forensic analysis completed on May 25, 2018, \nidentified some of your employees\xe2\x80\x99 personal information was contained in the email account.  \n\nWhat Information Was Involved\nIt is not clear whether your information was used for any inappropriate purposes. The information that \nmay have been accessed may include your name, HealthEquity member ID, employer name, \nHealthEquity employer ID, claim type, deduction amount, patient name, service date, payee, date \nprocessed, HealthEquity claim ID, and healthcare account type (e.g., FSA, HRA, or LPFSA). At this \ntime, we have no reason to believe that Social Security numbers were exposed. We do not know whether \nyour information has been used for any inappropriate purposes, or if it may be used for any inappropriate \npurposes in the future.  \n\nWhat We Are Doing\nHealthEquity immediately launched an investigation and secured the employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account to prevent \nfurther exposure. HealthEquity has adopted new security practices to prevent a similar incident from \noccurring in the future, including the implementation of technical security measures and retraining and re-\neducation of its workforce.   \nWhat We Are Offering  \nWe are offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts\xc2\xae, a data breach and recovery \nservices expert, to provide you with MyIDCare\xe2\x84\xa2.

We remain committed to protecting the security and \nconfidentiality of your information. \n\nSincerely, \n\nTrinity Car, Director of Privacy \nHealthEquity, Inc.\n\n\x0cImportant Information: Recommendations You Can Take to Protect Your Identity \n\nReview Your Accounts and Credit Reports \nYou should regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report \nfrom one or more of the national consumer reporting agencies. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n(FCRA), you may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com or by \ncalling toll free 1.877.322.8228. For more information about the FCRA, please visit \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. You may also contact one \nor more of the three national consumer reporting agencies listed below:  \nFraud Alerts and Security Freezes \nAt no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors \nto take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to \nobtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud \nalert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or \nshould you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed \nbelow. \n\nEquifax \n\nP.O.

Box 2000 \n\nChester, PA 19016 \n1-800-680-7289 \n\nwww.transunion.com\n\nYou may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau \nfrom releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written \nauthorization. However, please be advised that placing a security freeze may delay, interfere with, or \nprevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, \nhousing, or other services. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau \nwith a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other \ncases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security \nfreeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly range from $3 to $15. You will need to place a \nsecurity freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a \nfreeze on all of your credit files. To request a security freeze, you will need to supply your full name, \naddress, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to five previous \nyears, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.  \n\nTo find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information: \nEquifax Security Freeze \nP.O.

Coverage may not be available in all jurisdictions. \n\n3 \n\n\x0cIDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION and PROTECTION \n\n \nMonitor Your Accounts and Credit Reports, and Notify Police and the FTC of Suspicious Activity:  \nWhen you receive account statements, credit reports, and monitoring alerts, review them carefully for \nunauthorized activity. For example, look for accounts you did not open, unauthorized purchases, inquiries \nfrom creditors that you did not initiate, and personal information that you do not recognize, such as a home \naddress or Social Security number. If you have concerns, call your bank, the account provider, or the credit \nreporting agency at the telephone number on the statement or report. If possible, place a security verification \nword on your accounts.  \n \nIf you suspect any fraudulent activity or identity theft, promptly report it to local law enforcement authorities, \nyour state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. To file a complaint with the FTC, go to \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). \nRequest copies of any police or investigation reports created, as you might need to provide this information to \ncredit reporting agencies or to supposed creditors to clear up your records. \n \nObtain Free Credit Reports: Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, you should check your \ncredit report regularly. There are three main credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. \nTheir contact information, along with contact information for the FTC and some state agencies, are on the \nreverse side. Each credit reporting agency must provide you annually with a free credit report, at your request \nmade to a single, centralized source for the reports, AnnualCreditReport.com. You are not required to order all \nthree reports at the same time; instead, you may rotate your requests so that you can review your credit \nreport on a regular basis. In addition, many states have laws that require the credit reporting agencies to \nprovide you with a copy of your credit report, free of charge, whether or not you suspect any unauthorized \nactivity on your account.   \n \nFree Services by Credit Reporting Agencies:  Each credit reporting agency offers additional free services to \nhelp you protect your credit.  TransUnion at www.transunion.com permits you to sign up for TrueIdentity \nwhich is a service that allows you to examine your TransUnion credit file and place a \xe2\x80\x9ccredit lock\xe2\x80\x9d which \nprevents others from opening up credit in your name.  Experian at www.experian.com provides you with a \nfree credit report every month when you select \xe2\x80\x9cStart with your free Experian Credit Report.\xe2\x80\x9d  Equifax at \nwww.equifax.com permits you to sign up for \xe2\x80\x9cLock & Alert"" which also allows you to place a credit lock.  \n \nFraud Alert: You may ask the credit reporting agencies to place ""fraud alerts"" in your file to let potential \ncreditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft. A fraud alert can make it more difficult \nfor someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It \nalso may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the \nthree credit reporting agencies. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it is supposed to notify the \nother two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your file. An initial fraud alert stays in your file for at \nleast 90 days. An extended alert stays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a credit \nreporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social \nSecurity number. If you ask for an extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity \ntheft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency. \n \nSecurity Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report at any of the three \nmain credit reporting agencies. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being \napproved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may be \nable to use an online process, an automated telephone line, or a written request. If you choose to send a \n\n\x0cIDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION and PROTECTION \n\n \nrequest to a consumer reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail, the \nfollowing information must be included when requesting a security freeze: (1) full name, with middle initial \nand any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses \nfor the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency. The \nrequest must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill \nor bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing \naddress, and the date of issue. The consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a \nfreeze or lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity \ntheft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the agency.  The \nmain three credit reporting agencies provide details about their security freeze services and state \nrequirements at the following links: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Experion: \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Equifax: \n\nhttp://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/security-freeze/ \nhttps://help.equifax.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/159 &  \nhttps://help.equifax.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/75/~/security-freeze-fees-and-requirements \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  TransUnion:  https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze \n\n \nInternal Revenue Service:  Tax-related identity theft is when someone uses your Social Security number to file \na false tax return claiming a fraudulent refund.  If you received IRS correspondence indicating you may be a \nvictim of tax-related identity theft or your e-file tax return was rejected as a duplicate, take the following \nsteps with the IRS: \n \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Submit an IRS Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Continue to file your tax return, even if you must do so by paper, and attach the Form 14039 \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Watch for any follow-up correspondence from the IRS and respond quickly. \n\nThe fillable IRS Form 14039 is available at IRS.gov. Follow the instructions exactly. You can fax or mail it or \nsubmit it with your paper tax return if you have been prevented from filing because someone else has already \nfiled a return using your SSN.

Box 9532 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n1-888-397-3742 \nwww.experian.com \n\nFraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and \nwill stay on your credit file for at least 90 days.

Additional information \nis available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.\n\nSecurity Freeze: In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent \nnew credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate \nthe freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without \nyour consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must \nseparately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency.

Therefore  credit  monitoring  may  not  be  applicable  at  this  time.  All  other  services  provided  in  the \nmembership will apply. No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you, please follow the \ninstructions below to place the alert. \n \n1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://ide.myidcare.com/raileuropeprotect and follow the instructions for enrollment \nusing your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter. Once you have completed your enrollment, you will receive \na welcome letter by email (or by mail if you do not provide an email address when you sign up).

Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need \nassistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you. \n \n3.  Telephone.  Contact  MyIDCare  at  (888)  230-2184  to  gain  additional  information  about  this  event  and  speak  with \nknowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity. \n \n4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring \ncredit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of \nthe three  major credit  reporting  companies. To  obtain  a  free annual credit  report,  go  to  www.annualcreditreport.com  or \ncall 1-877-322-8228 or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to  Annual Credit Report \nRequest  Service,  P.O.  Box  105281,  Atlanta,  GA  30348-5281.  (You  can  print  a  copy  of  the  request  form  at \nwww.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf.)  You may wish to stagger your requests so that \nyou receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.  \n\nWhen you receive your credit reports, please carefully review them for accounts that you did not open and inquiries from \ncreditors that you did not initiate. Please also look for any personal information, such as home address or Social Security \nNumber,  that  is  inaccurate.    If  you  discover  any  suspicious  items  and  have  enrolled  in  MyIDCare,  notify  them \nimmediately by calling or by visiting their Member website and filing a theft report.  Otherwise,  call the credit-reporting \nagency at the telephone number on the report.    \n\nIf  you  file  a  theft  report  with  MyIDCare,  you  will  be  contacted  by  a  member  of  our  ID  Care  team  who  will  help  you \ndetermine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of \nthis incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the \ndamage quickly.  \n \nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that \nin order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide \nsome  kind  of  proof  that  you  have  been  a  victim.  A  police  report  is  often  required  to  dispute  fraudulent  items  so  we \nrecommend that you request a copy of the police report because you may need to provide it to creditors to help correct \nyour credit report. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to other local law enforcement or to the Attorney \nGeneral.  \n \n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after \nactivating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also \nvia Experian\xe2\x80\x99s or Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, \nbefore  they  open  any  new  accounts  or  change  your  existing  accounts.  For  that reason,  placing  a  fraud  alert  can  protect \nyou, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows: \n \n \n\nPage 3 of 5 \n \n\n\x0c \n\nCredit Bureaus  \n\nEquifax Fraud Reporting \n1-866-349-5191 \nP.O. Box 105069 \nAtlanta, GA 30348-5069 \nwww.alerts.equifax.com  \n\nExperian Fraud Reporting \n1-888-397-3742 \nP.O. Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013 \nwww.experian.com \n \n\nTransUnion Fraud Reporting \n1-800-680-7289 \nP.O. Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19022-2000 \nwww.transunion.com  \n\nIt  is  necessary  to contact  only  ONE  of  these  bureaus and  use  only  ONE  of  these  methods.  As  soon  as  one  of the three \nbureaus  confirms  your  fraud  alert,  the  others  are  notified  to  place  alerts  on  their  records  as  well.  You  will  receive \nconfirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.  \n  \n6.  Security  Freeze.  By  placing  a  security  freeze,  someone  who  fraudulently  acquires  your  personal  identifying \ninformation will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need \nto contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when \nyou  place  the  freeze,  you  will  not  be  able  to  borrow  money,  obtain  instant  credit,  or  get  a  new  credit  card  until  you \ntemporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live in and for \neach credit reporting bureau. The Credit Bureau may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze, lift, or remove a freeze. \nHowever, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement agency or submitted \nan ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission, there may be no charge to place the freeze.  \n \n7.  You  can  obtain  additional  information  about  the  steps  you  can  take  to  avoid  identity  theft  from  the  following \nagencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to \nfile a complaint with them. \n \n \nALL US RESIDENTS: Contact the Identity Theft Clearinghouse, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, \nNW Washington, DC 20580, www.consumer.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), TTY: 1-866-653-4261. \n \nCalifornia Residents: Visit the California Office of Privacy Protection (www.privacy.ca.gov ) for additional information \non protection against identity theft.  \n \nColorado Residents:  Contact the Colorado Bureau of Investigation at 1-855-443-3489 or \nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cbi/identity-theft-fraud-and-cyber-crimes-victim-support \n\nConnecticut Residents:  Contact the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection at 1-800-842-2649 or  \nhttp://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?a=1629&Q=289488&PM=1 \n\nFlorida Residents: Contact the Florida Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1-866-966-7226 or \nhttp://www.myfloridalegal.com/identitytheft \n\nIllinois Residents: Contact the Illinois Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1-866-999-5630 or \nhttp://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/consumers/idtheft.html \n\nKentucky Residents: Contact the Office of the Attorney General of Kentucky, 700 Capitol Avenue, Suite 118 Frankfort, \nKentucky 40601, www.ag.ky.gov, Telephone: 1-502-696-5300. \n \nMaryland  Residents:  Contact  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  Maryland,  Consumer  Protection  Division  200  St. \nPaul Place Baltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us/Consumer, Telephone: 1-888-743-0023.  \n \nNevada Residents:   Contact the Nevada Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1-702-486-3132 or \nhttp://ag.nv.gov/Hot_Topics/Victims/IDTheft/ \n\nNew Hampshire Residents:  Contact the New Hampshire Department of Justice at 1-603-271-3658 or \nhttp://www.doj.nh.gov/consumer/identity-theft/index.htm \n\nPage 4 of 5 \n \n\n\x0c \n\nNew Jersey Residents:  Contact the New Jersey Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1- 609-292-8740 or \nhttp://www.nj.gov/oag/dcj/idtheft/ \n\nNew York Residents: Contact the New York Department of State, Division of Consumer Protection at 1-800-697-1220 \nor https://www.dos.ny.gov/consumerprotection/identity_theft/ \n\nNorth Carolina Residents: Contact the Office of the Attorney General of North Carolina, 9001 Mail Service Center \nRaleigh, NC 27699-9001, www.ncdoj.com/, Telephone: 1-919-716-6400. \n \nOregon  Residents:  Contact  the  Oregon  Department  of  Justice,  1162  Court  Street  NE,  Salem,  OR  97301-4096, \nwww.doj.state.or.us, Telephone: 877-877-9392 \n \nPennsylvania Residents: Contact the Pennsylvania Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1-800-441-2555 or \nhttps://www.attorneygeneral.gov/Consumers/Identity_Theft/ \n\nRhode Island Residents: Contact the Office of the Attorney General, 150 South Main Street, Providence, Rhode Island \n02903, www.riag.ri.gov, Telephone: 401-274-4400 \n \nTexas Residents: Contact the Texas Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1-800-252-8011 or \nhttps://texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft \n\nVirginia Residents:  Contact the Virginia Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office at 1-804-786-4718 or \nhttp://www.oag.state.va.us/citizen-resources/identity-theft \n\nWisconsin Residents:  Contact the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, Bureau of \nConsumer Protection at 1-608-224-5163 or https://datcp.wi.gov/Pages/Programs_Services/IdentityTheft.aspx \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPage 5 of 5 \n \n\n\x0c'",https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2018/05/30/rail-europe-sas-notice-of-data-breach-to-consumers/,Vermont

It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing \naddress, and the date of issue.

You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed onyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays onyour credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have alreadybeen a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit reportfor seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reportingagencies.Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so thatno new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate afreeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without yourconsent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your creditreport unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Inaddition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. Thecost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at eachcredit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each creditreporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact thethree major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three (3) major reportingagencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below:Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.comTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.comEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\x0cTo request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:1.Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)2.Social Security number3.Date of birth4.If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years5.Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill6.A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, militaryidentification, etc.)7.If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a lawenforcement agency concerning identity theftThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on yourcredit report.

Unfortunately, there  was a network security breach at www.unoallavolLa.com  during the period \nbetween April 18, 2018 and May 1, 2018, that may  have compromised your personal information. \n\nWhat Happened \nOn May 1, 2018, we were notified by a visitor to the  website https://www.unoallavolta.com/ that the visitor\'s web \nbrowser had displayed a  warning relating to the website.  An investigation confirmed that a network intruder had \ninstalled malicious code on our website that allowed the intruder to obtain access to certain personal information \nprovided by customers on our website during the period the code was active, beginning on April 18th and ending on \nMay 1, 2018 when the code was identified and  immediately disabled. \n\nWhat Information Was Involved \nThe incident involved customer names and addresses as well as credit card numbers, CCV#s, and expiration dates. \nNo other information was accessed. \n\nWhat We Are Doing \nWe take the security of our customers\' personal information very seriously.  Since the initial detection of this issue, \nwe have coordinated  with our vendors to remediate the incident.  In addition to immediately disabling the malicious \ncode upon detection to prevent exposure of additional data, we have implemented additional safeguards to prevent \nsimilar intrusions from  occurring in the future, including resetting passwords and increasing network security \nmeasures.  After conducting an investigation to confirm the details of the incident and its scope, we are  now moving \nswiftly to notify potentially  impacted customers. \n\nWhat You Can Do \nWhile we have no information  to indicate that your information has been or will  be misused, we recommend, as a \nprecautionary step, that you immediately place a fraud  alert on your credit file.  A fraud  alert tells creditors to \ncontact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.  To do so, call any one of the three \nmajor credit bureaus listed below.  As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud  alert, the others are notified to \nplace fraud  alerts. \n\nEquifax \n1-800-525-6285 \nP.O.

You will  need to contact the three credit \nreporting agencies to place the security freeze.  Keep in  mind that when you  place the freeze, you will not  be able to \nborrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a  new credit card until you temporarily lift or  permanently remove the \nfreeze.  The cost of placing the freeze  is no more  than $10 for each United States credit reporting agency for  a total \nof $30.  However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed  a report with your local law enforcement \nagency or submitted an ID Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC""), there may be no charge to \nplace the freeze.

This is why we are contacting you, \noffering you credit and identity monitoring services and informing you about steps that can be taken to protect your \npersonal information. \n\nWhat Happened? In mid-January, Cable Hill Partners learned that the email account of a Cable Hill employee was \naccessed by an unknown third party. Upon discovery, we disabled the third party\xe2\x80\x99s access to the account and \nbrought together a team consisting of IT professionals and cybersecurity experts to determine the scope of the \nevent. Initial forensics indicated that personal information was not likely downloaded, however we could not be 100% \ncertain. We engaged a digital forensics firm to provide us assurance that a download did not occur, but their findings \nwere inconclusive. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we are treating this event as if personal data was \ndownloaded.

Box 6790 \nFullerton, CA 92834-6790 \n800-916-8800 \nwww.transunion.com \n\nYou should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report \nany suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law \nenforcement, your state\'s attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC""). You may contact the FTC or your state\'s \nregulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding and protection against identity theft: Federal Trade \nCommission, Consumer Response Center 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft.  \n\nResidents of Maryland, North Carolina and Rhode Island may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft by \ncontacting: Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-\n743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us; North Carolina Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division, 9001 Mail Service \nCenter, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-919-716-6400, www.ncdoj.gov; and Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General, Consumer \nProtection Unit, 150 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02903, 1-401-274-4400, www.riag.ri.gov. \n \nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be \na victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you \nsuspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 \ndays. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the \nappropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on \nyour credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the toll-free numbers listed below: \n \nEquifax \n877-478-7625 \n \nCredit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new \ncredit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze \nis designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, \npotential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. \nTherefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a \ncredit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state.

This letter provides you with more information \nabout what happened and informs you of additional steps we are taking to protect your personal information. We truly value your \nbusiness and understand the value you place on the protection of your information. \n\nWhat Happened? \n\nOn April 12, 2018, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to our systems.

You are receiving this letter because \nyou are a current or former employee of SP Industries, Inc. (\xe2\x80\x9cCompany\xe2\x80\x9d), for whom I performed certain accounting and \nauditing services. \n \nWhat Happened?  \n \nOn March 28, 2018, I learned that there was potentially unauthorized access from a foreign IP system to my e-mails from \napproximately  February  9-26,  2018.    The  investigation  is  now  complete  but,  unfortunately,  the  forensic  IT  firm  cannot \ndetermine which files, if any, were actually accessed. Please note that this incident did not involve any of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s \ncomputer systems or its email accounts. Out of an abundance of caution, I am notifying everyone whose information was \npotentially accessible.         \n \nWhat Information Was Involved?  \n \nAs noted above, you are receiving this letter because you are an employee or former employee of the Company for whom \nI performed work.

Go to www.idexpertscorp.com/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your \nEnrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring \ncredit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of \nthe three  major credit  reporting  companies. To  obtain  a  free annual credit  report,  go  to  www.annualcreditreport.com  or \ncall 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit \nbureaus every four months.  \n\nIf you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by visiting \ntheir Member website and filing a theft report.  \n\nIf  you  file  a  theft  report  with  MyIDCare,  you  will  be  contacted  by  a  member  of  our  ID  Care  team  who  will  help  you \ndetermine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of \nthis incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the \ndamage quickly.  \n\nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that \nin order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide \nsome  kind  of  proof  that  you  have  been  a  victim.  A  police report is  often required  to  dispute fraudulent  items.  You  can \nreport suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.  \n\n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after \nactivating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also \nvia Experian\xe2\x80\x99s or Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, \nbefore  they  open  any  new  accounts  or  change  your  existing  accounts.  For  that reason,  placing  a  fraud  alert  can  protect \nyou, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows: \n\n \n200423.03657/107624614v.2 \n\n\x0c \n \n\nCredit Bureaus  \n\nEquifax Fraud Reporting \n1-866-349-5191 \nP.O.

Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19022-2000 \n\nwww.alerts.equifax.com  \n\nwww.experian.com \n\nwww.transunion.com  \n\nIt  is  necessary  to contact  only  ONE  of  these  bureaus and  use  only  ONE  of  these  methods.  As  soon  as  one  of the three \nbureaus  confirms  your  fraud  alert,  the  others  are  notified  to  place  alerts  on  their  records  as  well.  You  will  receive \nconfirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.  \n\n6.  Security  Freeze.  By  placing  a  security  freeze,  someone  who  fraudulently  acquires  your  personal  identifying \ninformation will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need \nto contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when \nyou  place  the  freeze,  you  will  not  be  able  to  borrow  money,  obtain  instant  credit,  or  get  a  new  credit  card  until  you \ntemporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live in and for \neach credit reporting bureau. The Credit Bureau may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze, lift, or remove a freeze. \nHowever, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement agency or submitted \nan ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission, there may be no charge to place the freeze.  \n\n7.  You  can  obtain  additional  information  about  the  steps  you  can  take  to  avoid  identity  theft  from  the  following \nagencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to \nfile a complaint with them. \n\nCalifornia Residents: Visit the California Office of Privacy Protection (www.privacy.ca.gov) for additional information \non protection against identity theft.  \n\nMaryland  Residents:  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  Maryland,  Consumer  Protection  Division  200  St.  Paul  Place \nBaltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us/Consumer, Telephone: 1-888-743-0023.  \n\nNorth  Carolina  Residents:  Office of the  Attorney  General  of  North  Carolina, 9001  Mail  Service  Center,  Raleigh,  NC \n27699-9001, www.ncdoj.com/, Telephone: 1-919-716-6400. \n\nOregon Residents: Oregon Department of Justice, 1162 Court Street NE, Salem, OR 97301-4096, www.doj.state.or.us/, \nTelephone: 877-877-9392 \n\nAll  US  Residents:  Identity  Theft  Clearinghouse,  Federal  Trade  Commission,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, www.consumer.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), TTY: 1-866-653-4261. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n200423.03657/107624614v.2 \n\n\x0c'",https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2018/05/08/sp-industries-inc-notice-of-data-breach-to-consumers/,Vermont

Seevers, Jr., Ph.D. \nPresident \nGlobal University\n\n\x0cSTEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO BETTER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION \n\nMonitor Your Accounts. \n\nCredit Reports.  We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account \nstatements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit \nreport  annually  from  each  of  the  three  major  credit  reporting  bureaus.  To  order  your  free  credit  report,  visit \nwww.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly \nto request a free copy of your credit report. \n\nFraud Alerts.  At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors to \ntake additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells \ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies \nyour identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your \nfile. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact \nany one of the agencies listed below: \n\nEquifax \n\nP.O. Box 105069 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n\n800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com\n\nExperian \n\nP.O. Box 2002 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n888-397-3742 \n\nwww.experian.com\n\nTransUnion \nP.O. Box 2000 \n\nChester, PA 19106 \n\n800-680-7289 \n\nwww.transunion.com\n\nSecurity Freeze.  You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau \nfrom releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. However, \nplease be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval \nof any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. If you have been a \nvictim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or \nremove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently \nremove a security freeze.  Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly range from $3 to $15.  You will need to place \na security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a freeze on all of \nyour credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will need to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social \nSecurity  number,  current  address,  all  addresses  for  up  to  five  previous  years,  email  address,  a  copy  of  your  state \nidentification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility bill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving \nresidence.

You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on\nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.  An initial fraud alert stays on\nyour  credit  report  for  at  least  90  days.   You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already\nbeen a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report\nfor seven years.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting\nagencies.\n\nCredit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no\nnew credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.  A\ncredit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  If you\nplace a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless\nyou temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  In addition, you may\nincur  fees  to  place,  lift  and/or  remove  a  credit  freeze.    Credit  freeze  laws  vary  from  state  to  state.    The  cost  of  placing,\ntemporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting\ncompany.   Fee amount for Massachusetts residents to place, lift, or remove a security freeze cannot exceed $5 per action.\nUnlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file thatyou suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan orcredit. Instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised andrequires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. Although this may cause someshort delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtainingcredit in your name.To place a fraud alert, contact any of the three major credit reporting agencies listed above and requestthat a fraud alert be put on your file. The agency that you contacted must notify the other two agencies.A fraud alert is free and lasts 90 days, but can be renewed.Security Freeze: Certain U.S. state laws, including in Massachusetts, provide the right to place a securityfreeze on your credit file. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing anyinformation from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report until the freeze is lifted. When a security freeze is in place,no one\xe2\x80\x94including you\xe2\x80\x94can open a new account. As a result, please be aware that placing a securityfreeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requestsyou make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.\x0c(cid:128)(cid:44)(cid:65)(cid:46)(cid:81)(cid:7)(cid:65)(cid:25)(cid:67)(cid:17)(cid:94)(cid:33)(cid:94)(cid:20)(cid:80)(cid:12)(cid:81)(cid:43)\n(cid:128)(cid:22)(cid:8)(cid:124)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:93)(cid:48)(cid:42)(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:52)(cid:93)(cid:114)(cid:70)(cid:122)(cid:53)(cid:86)\n(cid:121)(cid:25)(cid:41)(cid:105)(cid:73)(cid:121)(cid:25)(cid:41)(cid:9)(cid:105)(cid:89)(cid:9)(cid:121)(cid:73)(cid:121)(cid:41)(cid:73)(cid:41)\n\n03-03-1\n\nTo place a security freeze, contact all three credit reporting agencies listed above and provide thepersonal information required by each agency to place a freeze, which may include:1.Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);2.Social Security Number;3.Date of birth;4.If you have moved in the past five (5) years, the addresses where you have lived over the priorfive years;5.Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;6.A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or IDcard, military identification, etc.);7.If you are a victim of identity theft, a copy of either a police report, investigative report, orcomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft; and8.If you are not a victim of identity theft, payment by check, money order, or credit card (Visa,MasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through the mail.When you place a security freeze, you will be provided a PIN to lift temporarily or remove the securityfreeze. A security freeze generally lasts until you lift or remove it, although in some jurisdictions it willexpire after seven years. The cost to place a security freeze is typically between $5.00 and $10.00each time you place a freeze, but may vary by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions may also permit a creditreporting agency to charge you similar fees to lift or remove the freeze. If you have been a victim ofidentity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with a valid police report, it cannot charge youto place, lift, or remove a security freeze.Credit Lock: Like a security freeze, a credit lock restricts access to your credit report and preventsanyone from opening an account until unlocked. Unlike security freezes, your credit can typically beunlocked online without delay. To lock your credit, contact all three credit reporting agencies listedabove and complete a credit lock agreement. The cost of a credit lock varies by agency, which typicallycharges monthly fees.You may also contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) for further information on fraudalerts, security freezes, credit locks, and how to protect yourself from identity theft.

We  immediately  began  to  investigate  this  activity,  and  worked  with  leading  \nthird-party forensic investigators to learn more about the nature and scope of the incident. Through this investigation, \nwe learned on or around November 28, 2017, that several employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized \nlogins by an unknown actor.  Unfortunately, we were not able to determine whether or not the unknown actor viewed \nspecific emails and/or attachments.  The emails in the accounts were reviewed to identify the information in them \nand the individuals to whom the information may relate. Through this review, we determined on Jan. 24, 2018 that \nyour personal information may have been impacted. Since that time, we have been diligently working to identify the \nindividuals who may have been impacted by this event and confirm the address information related to same. \n<<Data Elements Paragraph>>  \nWhat We Are Doing: We take this incident and the security of your personal information seriously.

An external security firm was also engaged to verify our findings, confirm the prevention \nsteps  we  undertook  were  appropriate,  and  assist  with  identifying  the  full  extent  of  the  information  that  could  have \npotentially  been  accessible  as  a  result  of  this  incident.  On  March  1,  2018,  we  determined  that  the  following  types  of \nconfidential  information  may  have  been  accessible  as  a  result  of  the  misconfiguration:  members\xe2\x80\x99  full  name,  date(s)  of \nservice, employer group health plan name, date of birth and providers\xe2\x80\x99 full names. In addition, for some members, social \nsecurity  numbers  may  have  been  involved.  However,  we  are  currently  not  aware  of  any  misuse  of  members\xe2\x80\x99  protected \nhealth and/or personal information.    \n\nWe  take  this  matter  very  seriously  and  sincerely  apologize  that  this  situation  has  occurred.

Under U.S. law you are entitled to one \nfree credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.  To order your free  credit report, visit \nwww.annualcreditreport.com  or  call,  toll-free,  1-877-322-8228.    You  may  also  contact  the  three  major  credit  bureaus \ndirectly to request a free copy of your credit report. \n\nAt  no  charge,  you  can  also  have  these  credit  bureaus  place  a  \xe2\x80\x9cfraud  alert\xe2\x80\x9d  on  your  file  that  alerts  creditors  to  take \nadditional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name.  Note, however, that because it tells creditors \nto follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your \nidentity.  As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file.  \nShould you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any \none of the agencies listed below. \n\n \nEquifax \nP.O.

However, please be advised \nthat  placing  a  security  freeze  on  your  credit  report  may  delay,  interfere  with,  or  prevent  the  timely  approval  of  any \nrequests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.  If you have been a victim of \nidentity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, list or remove a \nsecurity freeze.  In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a \nsecurity  freeze.    You  will  need  to  place  a  security  freeze  separately  with  each  of  the  three  major  credit  bureaus  listed \nabove if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files.

This  letter  contains  information  about  steps  that  you  can  take  to \nprotect yourself and about resources that we are making available to help you.   \n\n \nWhat happened?  On January 10, 2018, CDHA was contacted by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and told \nthat the police had discovered that a CDHA employee had stolen personal information belonging to CDHA patients. We \nbegan an investigation to identify any other patient records  that the employee may have accessed and  what information \nwas  contained  in  those  records.  We  fired  the  employee  involved  and  have  continued  to  cooperate  with  the  police \ninvestigation. In connection with our desire to assist the authorities with their ongoing investigation, at their request, we \ndelayed sending this notification. \n\n \nWhat information was involved?  It is likely that most of the patient records we have identified as being accessed by this \nemployee  were  appropriately  accessed  in  connection  with  providing  patient  services.  However,  based  upon  the \ninformation we have been given by the police department, it is possible your patient information may have been accessed \nby this employee.

If you believe that you have suffered fraud or identity theft as a result of this incident, please file a \npolice report by contacting the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department at 704.336.7600.

Box 105851 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n1-800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com \n \nFraud Alert:  You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.  An initial fraud alert is free and will \nstay on your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report \nand requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.  To place a fraud alert on your \ncredit  report,  contact  any  of  the  three  credit  reporting  agencies  identified  above. Additional  information  is  available  at \nhttp://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n \nSecurity Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will prevent \nnew credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the \nfreeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  \nAs a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a \nsecurity  freeze  on  your  credit  file  with  each  credit  reporting  agency.    If  you  request  a  security  freeze  from  a  consumer \nreporting  agency  there  may  be  a  fee  up to  $10  to  place,  lift  or  remove  the  security  freeze.

Under\nU.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.\nTo order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may\nalso contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.\n\nAt no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xc2\x93fraud alert\xc2\x94 on your file that alerts creditors to take\nadditional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells\ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the\nagency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to\nplace fraud alerts on your file.

Some of your personal information was \nincluded in our email system, so we want to let you know what occurred, what we are doing to address it, and how you can enroll in \nconsumer protection services we are offering. We want to emphasize that our expert\xe2\x80\x99s investigation concluded it was unlikely any \npersonal information was taken in this incident, but we value your trust and believe it is important to notify you so that you can take \nsteps to protect yourself. We take privacy and data security very seriously, and we deeply regret that this incident occurred.  \n\nWhat Happened? \n\nOn March 19, 2018, we discovered that an unauthorized individual had gained access to our email system. We immediately \neliminated the unauthorized access and also implemented additional access controls to prevent further access. We engaged legal \ncounsel who hired a forensic investigator to determine what had occurred and whether any of our clients were affected and if so to \nwhat extent. \n\nThe investigation concluded on April 19, 2018. The forensic expert determined that the unauthorized access occurred between \nMarch 8th and March 19th, and was limited to our email system. It did not impact any other information systems or financial \naccounts. Our emails did, however, include some of your personal information, such as your \xe2\x80\x9cField1\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9dField2\xe2\x80\x9d The forensic \ninvestigation found no evidence that these emails were downloaded or forwarded out of the system. The investigation also \nconcluded that the unauthorized individual appeared to be looking for information to perpetrate wire transfer fraud, although there \nwere no successful wire transfer requests made. We believe this evidence indicates it is unlikely this individual was seeking personal \ninformation or sought access for that purpose. However, we believe it is important to notify you in keeping with our compliance \nobligations and our relationship to you. We also wanted to contact you so we could offer consumer protection services. \n\nWhat Information Was Involved? \n\nSome personal information was included in the emails in our system, such as your \xe2\x80\x9cField3\xe2\x80\x9d. However, our forensic expert found no \nevidence that the emails including personal information were downloaded or forwarded, and we have no indication that any \ninformation about you has been misused. \n\nWhat We Are Doing. \n\nAs described above, as soon as we discovered the unauthorized access we eliminated it by terminating and reissuing all access \ncredentials. We promptly engaged legal counsel and a forensic expert, who launched an investigation. We implemented additional \naccess controls and enhanced system logging, and we will continue to evaluate additional controls. We are now notifying you so that \nyou can take steps to protect yourself, such as enrolling to receive the consumer protection services described below. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nWe have secured the services of CyberScout to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for two years.

An initial fraud alert is free and will \nstay on your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report \nand requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.  To place a fraud alert on your \ncredit  report,  contact  any  of  the  three  credit  reporting  agencies  identified  above. Additional  information  is  available  at \nhttp://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n \nSecurity Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will prevent \nnew credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number  that is issued to you when you initiate the \nfreeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  \nAs a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit.

If  you  request  a  security  freeze  from  a  consumer \nreporting  agency  there  may  be  a  fee  up to  $10  to  place,  lift  or  remove  the  security  freeze.

Box 105851 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n1-800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com \n \n\nFraud Alert:  You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.  An initial fraud alert is free and will \nstay on your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report \nand requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.  To place a fraud alert on your \ncredit report, contact  any  of  the three  credit reporting  agencies identified  above.    Additional  information  is  available at \nhttp://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n \nSecurity Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.  This will prevent \nnew credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the \nfreeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  \nAs a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a \nsecurity  freeze  on  your  credit  file  with  each  credit  reporting  agency.    If  you  request a  security  freeze  from  a  consumer \nreporting  agency  there  may  be  a  fee  up to  $10  to  place,  lift  or  remove  the  security  freeze.    In  order to  place  a security \nfreeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your \nfull name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification \ncard, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.   \n \nAdditional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your \nrespective state Attorney General about steps you  can take toward preventing identity theft.  You may report suspected \nidentity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.  \n \nFederal Trade Commission \n600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW \nWashington, DC  20580 \nconsumer.ftc.gov, and \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft \n1-877-438-4338 \n\nMaryland Attorney General \n200 St. Paul Place \nBaltimore, MD 21202 \noag.state.md.us \n1-888-743-0023 \n\nRhode Island \nAttorney General \n150 South Main Street \nProvidence, RI 02903 \nhttp://www.riag.ri.gov \n401-274-4400 \n\nNorth Carolina \nAttorney General \n9001 Mail Service \nCenter \nRaleigh, NC 27699 \nncdoj.gov \n1-877-566-7226 \n\n \nYou  also  have  certain  rights  under  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act  (FCRA),  including:    to  know  what  is  in  your  file;  to \ndispute  incomplete  or  inaccurate  information;  to  have  consumer  reporting  agencies  correct  or  delete  inaccurate, \nincomplete,  or  unverifiable  information,  as  well  as  others.

Upon learning of the incident, we immediately \nsecured  the  portal,  requested  the  internet  search  engines  to  remove  all  cached  data  related  to  this  matter,  continued  to \nmonitor these efforts, and conducted an internal investigation to determine the root cause of the incident and to prevent \nthe incident from reoccurring. An external security firm was also engaged  to verify our findings, confirm the prevention \nsteps  we  undertook  were  appropriate,  and  assist  with  identifying  the  full  extent  of  the  information  that  could  have \npotentially  been  accessible  as  a  result  of  this  incident.  On  March  1,  2018,  we  determined  that  the  following  types  of \nconfidential  information  may  have  been  accessible  as  a  result  of  the  misconfiguration:  members\xe2\x80\x99  full  name,  date(s)  of \nservice, employer group health plan name, date of birth, and providers\xe2\x80\x99 full names.

Under U.S. law you are entitled to one \nfree credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.  To order your free credit report, visit \nwww.annualcreditreport.com  or  call,  toll-free,  1-877-322-8228.    You  may  also  contact  the  three  major  credit  bureaus \ndirectly to request a free copy of your credit report. \n \nAt  no  charge,  you  can  also  have  these  credit  bureaus  place  a  \xe2\x80\x9cfraud  alert\xe2\x80\x9d  on  your  file  that  alerts  creditors  to  take \nadditional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name.  Note, however, that because it tells creditors \nto follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your \nidentity.  As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file.  \nShould you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any \none of the agencies listed below. \n \n \nEquifax \nP.O.

A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from releasing any \ninformation from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization.  However, please be advised \nthat  placing  a  security  freeze  on  your  credit  report  may  delay,  interfere  with,  or  prevent  the  timely  approval  of  any \nrequests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.  If you have been a victim of \nidentity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, list or remove a \nsecurity freeze.  In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a \nsecurity  freeze.    You  will  need  to  place  a  security  freeze  separately  with  each  of  the  three  major  credit  bureaus  listed \nabove if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files.  To find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can \nuse the following contact information: \n \nEquifax Security Freeze \nP.O.

It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing \naddress, and the date of issue.

The fee is waived if you are a victim of identity theft and have submitted a valid investigative or \nlaw enforcement report or complaint relating to the identity theft incident to the credit reporting agencies.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questionsregarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:Security Freeze.

If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with avalid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a creditbureau may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary basedon where you live, but commonly range from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately witheach of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files.

280,Thermo Fisher Scientific ,"b'Thermo Fisher Scientific\n168 Third Ave.\nWaltham, MA 02451\n\n<<Date>> (Format: Month Day, Year)\n\n<<MemberFirstName>> <<MemberLastName>> <<NameSuffix>>\n<<Address1>>\n<<Address2>>\n<<City>>, <<State>> <<ZipCode>>\n\nNotice of Data Security Incident\n\nDear <<MemberFirstName>> <<MemberLastName>>:\n\nI am writing to make you aware of a data security incident at Thermo Fisher Scientific involving your personal information, \nas described below. This letter explains the incident, measures the company has taken and some actions you can take \nin response. Thermo Fisher takes information security very seriously and sincerely regrets that this incident occurred and \nany concern or inconvenience it may cause you.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nThermo Fisher learned from federal law enforcement authorities that unauthorized third parties compromised a small \npercentage of the company\xe2\x80\x99s email accounts during some portion of 2017. They advised us that our company was \none of a large number of corporations that this group has targeted and that federal law enforcement authorities were \nactively investigating the group. Although the date when the compromise began has not been conclusively determined, \nour investigation to date confirms that certain emails from on or about July 6, 2017 through October 13, 2017 were \nacquired by unauthorized third parties.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved\n\nBased on our investigation to date, we believe that your name and social security number were among the \ninformation contained in the affected emails.\n\nWe have no indication that any information obtained in this incident was actually viewed by any unauthorized third \nparty or has been misused.\n\nWhat We Are Doing\n\nUpon learning of the incident, Thermo Fisher immediately began its own investigation with the assistance of outside \nexperts and has been working closely with federal law enforcement authorities in connection with their investigation of \nthis incident. The company also promptly took steps to secure the affected accounts, including requiring employees \nto change their passwords. In addition, Thermo Fisher has enhanced its email security and expects to continue \nto make security enhancements to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Law enforcement \nauthorities requested that the company delay making any notification of this incident to avoid interference with their \ninvestigation. We are notifying you now, after coordinating with law enforcement, so that you can take the steps \nrecommended below. \n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nThe company encourages you to remain vigilant and take steps to protect against identity theft or fraud. We recommend \nthat you monitor your accounts and free credit reports for any signs of suspicious activity. Information about how \nto obtain a free credit report, security freezes, and other guidance is provided under \xe2\x80\x9cAdditional Resources\xe2\x80\x9d in the \nenclosed document, which we encourage you to review. \n\n93010Q-0318\n\n\x0cPage 2\nAs an added precaution, we are offering you 12 months of identity monitoring services at no charge to you.

You can request information regarding fraud alerts, \nsecurity freezes, and identity theft from the following credit reporting agencies:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Experian, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742, P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013 \n\xe2\x80\xa2  TransUnion, www.transunion.com, 1-888-909-8872, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016-2000 \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Equifax, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348\n\nYou can contact these credit bureaus to place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your credit file that alerts creditors to take additional \nsteps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. When one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, \nthe others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. \n\nA security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report \nwithout written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may \ndelay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, \nemployment, housing, or other services. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written \nrequest to each of the three major consumer reporting agencies listed above. You may need to pay a fee and will \nneed to provide the following information: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Social Security number \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Date of birth\n\xe2\x80\xa2  If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n\xe2\x80\xa2  A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or ID card, military \n\nidentification, etc.) \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report or complaint to \n\na law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  If you are not a victim of identity theft, include payment by check, money order or credit card (Visa, \n\nMasterCard, American Express or Discover only).

If you have been a victim \nof identity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, \nlift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to \nplace, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business \ndays after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send \nwritten confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number \n(PIN) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must call or \nsend a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name, address, and \nsocial security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as \nthe identities of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you \nwant the credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request \nto lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.

On February 25, 2018, Manduka learned of a potential data security incident involving the \nunauthorized installation of malware on our e-commerce web platform. As soon as we discovered the incident, we \ntook immediate steps to secure this information and contacted the appropriate law enforcement agencies.

In addition, we reported the matter to the payment card \nbrands in order to protect your payment card information and prevent fraudulent activity. We are also providing you \nwith information about steps that you can take to protect your personal information. Finally, we take the security of \nall information in our systems very seriously and have taken steps to enhance the security of Manduka customer \ninformation and our e-commerce web platform in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. \n\nWhat You Can Do: You can follow the recommendations on the following page to protect your personal information. \nWe recommend that you review your current and past credit and debit card account statements for discrepancies or \nunusual activity. If you see anything that you do not understand or that looks suspicious, or if you suspect that any \nfraudulent transactions have taken place, you should call the bank that issued the credit or debit card immediately.\n\nFor More Information: Further information about how to protect your personal information appears on the following \npage. If you have questions please call 1-???-???-????, Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. \xe2\x80\x93 8 p.m. CT, excluding \nmajor holidays.\n\nThank you for your loyalty to Manduka and your patience through this incident. We take your trust in us and this matter \nvery seriously. Please accept our sincere apologies and know that we deeply regret any worry or inconvenience that \nthis may cause you. \n\nSincerely,\n\nBeau J. Swenson\nChief Financial Officer\n\n??????-0318 Ad\n\n\x0cSTEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION\n\nReview Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity: As a precautionary measure, \nwe recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any \nsuspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account \nis maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to \nproper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nCopy of Credit Report: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting \nagencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by \ncompleting an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box \n105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can also contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies: \nEquifax \nP.O.

Box 9532 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n1-888-397-3742 \nwww.experian.com \n\nFraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and \nwill stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your \nreport and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud \nalert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information \nis available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.\n\nSecurity Freeze: In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent \nnew credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate \nthe freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without \nyour consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must \nseparately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. If you request a security \nfreeze from a consumer reporting agency there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In \norder to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that \nidentifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy \nof your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. \n\nAdditional Free Resources: You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from \nyour respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.

A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file thatyou suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan orcredit. Instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised andrequires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. Although this may cause someshort delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtainingcredit in your name.To place a fraud alert, contact any of the three major credit reporting agencies listed above and requestthat a fraud alert be put on your file. The agency that you contacted must notify the other two agencies.A fraud alert is free and lasts 90 days, but can be renewed.Credit Freeze: A credit freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from aconsumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report until the freeze is lifted. When a credit freeze is in place, no one\xe2\x80\x94includingyou\xe2\x80\x94can open a new account.

If you detect any \nsuspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account \nis maintained.  You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to \nproper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d). \n \nCopy of Credit Report:   You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting \nagencies  once  every  12  months  by  visiting  http://www.annualcreditreport.com/,  calling  toll-free  877-322-8228,  or  by \ncompleting  an  Annual  Credit  Report  Request  Form  and  mailing  it  to  Annual  Credit  Report  Request  Service,  P.O.  Box \n105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.  You can also contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:  \n \n\nEquifax \nP.O. Box 105851 \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \n1-800-525-6285 \nwww.equifax.com \n\nExperian \nP.O. Box 9532 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n1-888-397-3742 \nwww.experian.com \n\nTransUnion \nP.O. Box 1000 \nChester, PA 19016 \n1-877-322-8228 \nwww.transunion.com \n\n \nFraud Alert:  You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.  An initial fraud alert is free and will \nstay on your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your repor t \nand requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.  To place a fraud alert on your \ncredit  report,  contact  any  of  the  three  credit  reporting  agencies  identified  above.  Additional  information  is  available  at \nhttp://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n \nSecurity  Freeze:    In  some  U.S.  states,  you  have  the  right  to  put a  security  freeze  on  your  credit  file.   This will  prevent \nnew credit from being  opened in your name  without the use of a PIN number  that is issued to you when you initiate the \nfreeze.  A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  \nAs a result, using a security freeze  may  interfere  with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You  must separately place a \nsecurity  freeze  on  your  credit  file  with  each  credit  reporting  agency.    If  you  request  a  security  freeze  from  a  consumer \nreporting  agency  there  may  be  a  fee  up  to  $10  to  place,  lift  or  remove  the  security  freeze.    In  order  to  place  a  security \nfreeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your \nfull name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification \ncard, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.   \n \nAdditional  Free  Resources:   You  can  obtain  information  from  the  consumer  reporting  agencies,  the  FTC  or  from  your \nrespective  state Attorney  General  about  steps  you  can  take  toward  preventing  identity  theft.   You  may  report  suspected \nidentity  theft  to  local  law  enforcement,  including  to  the  FTC  or  to  the  Attorney  General  in  your  state.

You will then receive letters from the agencies with \ninstructions on how to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Equifax (888)766-0008 or www.fraudalert.equifax.com \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Experian (888) 397-3742 or www.experian.com \n\xe2\x80\xa2 TransUnion (800) 680-7289 or www.transunion.com \n\nYou may also want to consider placing a Security Freeze on your credit reports. A Security \nFreeze prevents most potential creditors from viewing your credit reports and therefore, further \nrestricts the opening of unauthorized accounts.  \n\nIt  is  a  harsh  reality  that  cybersecurity  and  identity  theft  is  becoming  more  and  more \ncommon place in our lives, with major data breaches being reported on an almost weekly basis. \nFor this  reason, we recommend that  you always remain vigilant by reviewing  your  account \nstatements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you \nshould promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. \nWhen you receive  a credit report from each agency,  carefully review the reports. Check  for \naccounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, and confirm that your \npersonal information, such as home address and Social Security number, is accurate. If you see \nanything you do not understand or recognize, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone \nnumber on the report. You should also call your local police department and file a report of \nidentity theft. Get and keep a copy of the police report because you may need to give copies to \ncreditors to clear up your records or to access transaction records. \n\nEven  if  there  are  no  signs  of  suspicious  activity  on  your  credit  reports,  we  always \nrecommend that you remain vigilant in monitoring your credit reports from the three major credit \nreporting agencies. A victim\xe2\x80\x99s personal information is sometimes held for use or shared among \na group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot \nand address problems quickly. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 \nmonths  by  visiting  www.annualcreditreport.com,  calling  toll-free  877-322-8228  or  by \ncompleting an Annual Credit Request Form at: \n\nwww.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/rights.shtm and mailing \n\nto: Annual Credit Report Request Service, \nP.O.

ABM determined, after a programmatic and manual review of the \ncontents of the affected email accounts, the types of protected information contained in the affected email accounts \nand to which individuals the information relates.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved?

An initial fraud alert is \nfree and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days.  The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent \nactivity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your \nname.

Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com. \n\nSecurity Freeze:  In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.

A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your \ncredit report without your consent.  As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability \nto  obtain  credit. You  must  separately  place  a  security  freeze  on  your  credit  file  with  each  credit  reporting \nagency.  If you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there may be a fee up to $10 to \nplace, lift or remove the security freeze.  In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the \nconsumer  reporting  agency  with  information  that  identifies  you  including  your  full  name,  Social  Security \nnumber, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of  your state-issued identification card, and a \nrecent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.   \n\nAdditional Free Resources:  You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or \nfrom your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.

298,CNU Online Holdings LLC Notice of Data Security Incident to Consumers,"b""March __, 2018 \n\n \n\n[FName] [LName] \n[Address1] \n[Address 2] \n[City], [State] [Zip] \n\nRe:  Notice of Data Security Incident \n\nDear [FName]: \n\nWe recently became aware that an unauthorized party utilized the email address and password associated \nwith your NetCredit account to access your account.  We want to provide you with information on the \nsituation, including what happened, the steps we have taken, the ways you can reach us for further help or \nto answer questions, and the steps you may take to protect yourself against identity theft and fraud.   \n\nWHAT HAPPENED?  On or about February 20, 2018, our security team discovered that an unauthorized \nparty  used  valid  email  addresses  and  passwords  to  log  in  to  a  small  percentage  of  NetCredit  accounts.  \nBased on our investigation, we do not believe that the unauthorized party obtained account holder email \naddresses  or  passwords  from  us  or  that  our  security  systems  were  breached.    In  some  instances,  after \ngaining  access  to  an  account  using  the  login  credentials,  the  unauthorized  party  changed  some  of  the \npersonal information in the account, such as the email address and bank account information associated \nwith the account.   \n\nWHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED? Access to an account could have enabled the unauthorized \nparty to view the account holder's name, telephone number, physical address, last four digits of their bank \naccount  number,  NetCredit  account  number,  last  four  digits  of  their  Social  Security  number,  and  basic \nemployment and income information.   \n\nWHAT  WE  ARE  DOING.    Once  we  became  aware  of  the  incident,  we  took  steps  to  block  the \nunauthorized party and restricted access to the online accounts that we believe were affected.  Due to these \nsecurity precautions, you will not be able to access your account using your current password and will \nneed  to  change  your  password.  In  addition,  we  are  continuing  to  monitor  your  account  for  suspicious \nactivity.    \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO.  In order to regain access to your online account, you will need to change your \npassword by going to www.netcredit.com/signin, clicking on the \xe2\x80\x9cForgot password?\xe2\x80\x9d link, and following \nthe instructions there.  You can also call us at (877) 392-2014 to have a password reset link sent to you. \nWe  also  encourage  you  to  review  the  enclosed  information  on  how  to  ensure  the  security  of  your \ninformation with us, as well as how to protect yourself against identity theft or fraud.  \n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION.  We very much appreciate your business and the opportunity to serve you.  \nWe  take  very  seriously  the  trust  you  have  placed  in  us  by  choosing  us  as  a  financial  partner,  and  the \nsecurity of the personal information that our account holders entrust into our care is one of our highest \npriorities. \n  Our  team  is  here  and  ready  to  help.  You  can  reach  us  at  (877)  392-2014  or \nsupport@netcredit.com.   \n\nSincerely, \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cJason Such \nSenior Manager - Head of Servicing, Net Credit \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD \n \nYou may take action directly to further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss.  We \nencourage  you  to  be  vigilant  against  incidents  of  identity  theft  by  reviewing  your  account  statements \nregularly and monitoring your credit reports for suspicious activity.

Note, \nhowever, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your \nability to obtain credit while your identity is verified.  As soon as one credit reporting agency confirms \nyour fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file.  Should you wish to place a fraud \nalert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the credit \nreporting agencies listed below.   \n\nEquifax  Information Services LLC \nP.O.

In all other cases, a credit reporting \nagency may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze.  You will \nneed  to  place  a  security  freeze  separately  with  each  of  the  three  major  credit  reporting  agencies  listed \nabove if you wish to place the freeze on all of your credit files.   \n\nTo find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can contact the credit reporting agencies using the \ninformation below: \n\nExperian Security Freeze \nP.O.

303,Cary E Williams CPA ,"b""Letterhead \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDATE \n\nNOTICE OF DATA BREACH \n\n \n[First Name] [Last Name] \n[Address1] [Address2]  \n[City, State Zip]  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \nDear [Name]:  \n\n \nWe are writing to provide you with details about a data incident involving Cary E. Williams CPA. You are receiving \nthis  letter  because  you  are  either  an  employee,  shareholder,  trustee,  or  partner  of  a  Cary  E.  Williams  CPA  client,  and \ntherefore some of your information was needed for their tax purposes.  \n\n \nWhat Happened?  \n\nOn January 29, 2018, we discovered that parts of our network were subject to a ransomware attack. We immediately \ncontacted our IT consultant, who stopped its migration and began an investigation into the matter. We also began running \ndeep scans and reviewing our systems to identify potential malicious malware on our network and its source. Additionally, \nwe have changed all system passwords and sought further outside support by hiring a specialized forensic IT investigator \nto lead those efforts.   \n\n \n On February 24, 2018, the specialized forensic IT firm concluded its investigation determining that hackers had \ngained unauthorized access to our system from unrecognized IP addresses. Through their investigation we have discovered \nthat the unauthorized access occurred through Remote Desktop Protocol between January 5, 2018 and February 2, 2018.  \n\n \n\nWhat Information Was Involved?  \n \n\nThis information may have included your: full name, address, Social Security number, and earnings information \n\nfrom that entity. \n  \nWhat We Are Doing.  \n \n\nIn addition to the steps outlined above, we notified the FBI, the IRS, all three credit bureaus, and applicable state \nagencies. We have also reviewed office procedures with our IT consultant and replaced impacted hard drives to eliminate \nmalicious remnants on our system. Lastly, we will work with law enforcement in any criminal investigation.  \n\n \n\n \n \nAs an added precaution, we are offering Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s Credit Watch Gold with WebDetect identity theft protection \nservices for one year at no charge to you.  A description of this product is provided in the attached material, which also \ncontains instructions about how to enroll (including your personal activation code).

You must complete \nthe enrollment process by June 30, 2018. We strongly recommend you consider enrolling in this product, at our expense, \nand reviewing the Additional Resources enclosed with this letter. \n\n \n\nWhat You Can Do. \n \n\nWe  encourage  you  to  take  advantage  of  the  complimentary  credit  services  we  are  providing.  Additionally,  we \nstrongly recommend that you review the enclosed \xe2\x80\x98Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information\xe2\x80\x99 to safeguard \nyour information. \n \n \n\n\x0cFor More Information. \n\n \nIn  our  decades  of  business,  this  is  our  first  direct  encounter  with  cyber-crime.

An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report \nfor at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity \ntheft with the appropriate documentary proof.

A credit \nfreeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  If you place a credit \nfreeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the \nfreeze.  Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or \nremove a credit freeze.  Credit freeze laws vary from state to state.  The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit \n\n\x0cfreeze  also  varies  by  state,  generally  $5  to  $20  per  action  at  each  credit  reporting  company.    Unlike  a  fraud  alert,  you  must \nseparately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.  Since the instructions for how to establish a \ncredit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out \nmore information: \n \n\nEquifax: \nExperian: \nTransUnion LLC:  P.O.

A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open \nany new accounts or change your existing accounts.

The contact information for all three credit bureaus is below. \nMonitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity. \nSecurity Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report.

The  following \ninformation  must be included  when requesting a security  freeze (note that if  you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this \ninformation must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) \ndate of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint \nwith  a  law  enforcement  agency  or  the  Registry  of  Motor  Vehicles.    The  request  must  also  include  a  copy  of  a  government-issued \nidentification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement.  It is essential that each copy be legible, display \nyour name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.  The consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place \na freeze or lift or remove a freeze, but is free if you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have \nsubmitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the consumer reporting agencies: \n\n \n\nEquifax Security Freeze \nP.O.

We are providing information on the incident, steps we have taken and ways in which you can \nprotect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so. \n\nWhat Happened? On November 27, 2017, we learned of phishing emails being sent from a Metro Wire employee\xe2\x80\x99s \nemail account to our vendors. We immediately changed the employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account credentials and launched an \ninvestigation into this activity to determine what happened. Firms with a focus on cybersecurity issues were retained \nto assist with our own internal investigation. The investigation determined that the Metro Wire employee received a \nphishing email containing an attachment with credential stealing capabilities. The employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account credentials \nwere captured through the malicious attachment and were used by unknown individual(s) to gain unauthorized access \nto the employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account. While the only unauthorized activity observed in the account was the transmission \nof phishing emails, we cannot rule out the possibility of the unknown individual(s) gaining access to any speci\xef\xac\x81c email \nor attachment in the account. In an abundance of caution, the entire account underwent a programmatic and manual \nreview to identify the personal information that may be contained within the account.\n\nWhat  Information  Was  Involved?  Through  the  programmatic  and  manual  review  of  the  employee  email  account, \nwe  determined  on  January  16,  2018,  that  the  following  information  related  to  you  may  have  been  contained  in  the \nemployee\xe2\x80\x99s email account at the time it was accessed by the unknown individual(s): <<ClientDef1(\xef\xac\x81rst and last name, \n[credit card information/\xef\xac\x81nancial account data/driver\xe2\x80\x99s license number])>> \n\nWhat We Are Doing. Metro Wire takes the security of your information very seriously. In addition to taking the steps \ndetailed above to terminate the unauthorized access, Metro Wire is providing you with information on how to protect \nagainst identity theft and fraud, as well as access to free identity monitoring services. Since discovering the phishing \nemails, we have been working to ensure the security of our systems and con\xef\xac\x81rm the nature and scope of this incident. \nMetro Wire is committed to continuing employee training designed to help them identify and properly report potential \nemail phishing scams. Finally, we are providing notice of this event to state Attorneys General as required.\n\nWhat You Can Do. Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Against Identity Theft and Fraud, which \ncontains instructions on how to activate free identity monitoring services, as well as information on what you can do to \nbetter protect yourself against the possibility of identity theft and fraud should you feel it is appropriate to do so.\n\nFor More Information. We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this may have caused.

Note, however, that because it tells creditors \nto follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency veri\xef\xac\x81es your \nidentity. As soon as one credit bureau con\xef\xac\x81rms your fraud alert, the others are noti\xef\xac\x81ed to place fraud alerts on your \xef\xac\x81le. \nShould you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact \nany one of the agencies listed below.\nEquifax \nP.O.

A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from releasing \nany  information  from  a  consumer\xe2\x80\x99s  credit  report  without  the  consumer\xe2\x80\x99s  written  authorization.  However,  please  be \nadvised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval \nof any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. If you have been \na victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, \nlist or remove a security freeze.

As you may be aware, as of January 1, 2018 Mulcahy, Pauritsch, Salvador & Co., Ltd. (\xe2\x80\x9cMPS\xe2\x80\x9d), your \nCPA for last year\xe2\x80\x99s tax season, was acquired by Mueller. Mueller takes the privacy and security of your information \nseriously, and sincerely apologizes for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains \ninformation about steps you can take to protect your information, and resources we are making available to help you.\n\n1. What happened and what information was involved:\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Mueller received a notice from the IRS that a small number of Mueller clients for whom MPS \nhad \xef\xac\x81led their returns in 2017 had been \xef\xac\x82agged for potentially fraudulent activity during the current tax \xef\xac\x81ling season. \nFor some clients, these fraudulently \xef\xac\x81led returns resulted in a deposit being made to the client\xe2\x80\x99s account previously \nused to accept tax refunds. We immediately hired a computer forensics company to assist us in investigating to \ndetermine if our systems had been compromised. On February 12, 2018, the forensic investigator informed us that \nin November, 2017, an unauthorized third party had accessed a computer system in MPS\xe2\x80\x99s Orland Park location. \nThis computer contained \xef\xac\x81les related to tax returns prepared at the Orland Park of\xef\xac\x81ce and may have contained \nyour name, address, Social Security number, wage information and bank account information if you provided it to \nus. We immediately secured this computer system and ensured that all other Mueller computer systems were not \nvulnerable to the same compromise.\n\n2. What we are doing and what you can do:\n\nWe sincerely regret any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. Because we at Mueller value you and the \nsecurity of your personal information, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost \nto you for one year.

Do not spend this money, as it must be returned to the IRS.\n2.

A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they \nopen any new accounts or change your existing accounts.

It is essential \nthat each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. The consumer reporting agency \nmay charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze, but is free if you are a victim of identity theft or the \nspouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the \nconsumer reporting agencies:\nEquifax Security Freeze \nP.O.

We are writing to ensure that you are aware of the incident so that you may take steps \nto protect your personal information should you feel it is appropriate to do so.\n\nWhat Happened? On or about November 14, 2017, CAA learned of phishing emails being sent from certain CAA \nemployees\xe2\x80\x99 email accounts. CAA immediately began to investigate this email activity and quickly changed the \ncredentials for these accounts. A third party forensic investigation \xef\xac\x81rm was retained to assist in determining what \nhappened and what information may be contained in the email accounts. The ongoing investigation has determined \nthat certain CAA employees were victims of a phishing attack that resulted in unauthorized access to their email \naccounts. We have not identi\xef\xac\x81ed any other suspicious activity occurring within the email accounts other than the \nunauthorized transmission of phishing emails but are unable to rule out access to any particular email or attachment \nin the account.\n\nWhat Information was Involved? We determined on December 29, 2017, that the following information relating \nto you was contained in one of the impacted email accounts at the time of this incident: <<ClientDef1(\xef\xac\x81rst and last \nname; [Insert Data Elements])>>. \n\nWhat We Are Doing? The con\xef\xac\x81dentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care is one of our highest \npriorities. When we discovered this incident, we immediately took steps to terminate the unauthorized access, \ndetermine how this event occurred, and con\xef\xac\x81rm what personal data may have been at risk as a result of this incident. \n\nTo help relieve concerns and restore con\xef\xac\x81dence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to \nprovide identity monitoring at no cost to you for two years. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, \nand their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of con\xef\xac\x81dential \ndata. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.\n\nIn addition to providing this notice to you and access to the free identity monitoring services listed above, we have \nbeen reviewing our existing policies and procedures, providing additional training on phishing emails and working \nwith our third-party forensic investigation team to ensure the security of our systems. We will also be providing notice \nto certain state Attorneys General and consumer reporting agencies as required.\n\nWhat You Can Do.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your \naccount statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled \nto one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit \nreport, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major \ncredit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.\nFraud Alerts. At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts \ncreditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit \nwhile the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified \nto place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding \nyour credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:\n\nEquifax\n\nP.O.

A security freeze prohibits a credit \nbureau from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. \nHowever, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent \nthe  timely  approval  of  any  requests  you  make  for  new  loans,  credit  mortgages,  employment,  housing,  or  other \nservices. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee \nto place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will \nneed to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

326,Jason’s Deli – Deli Management Inc. ,"b'Deli Management, Inc.\nNotice of a Data Breach\n\nNOTICE OF DATA BREACH\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nOn December 22, 2017, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli was notified by payment processors that credit card \nsecurity personnel had informed it that a large quantity of payment card information had appeared \nfor sale on the \xe2\x80\x9cdark web,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an analysis of the data indicated that at least a portion of the \ndata may have come from various Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli locations. Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli\xe2\x80\x99s management immediately \nactivated our response plan, including engagement of a leading threat response team, involvement \nof other forensic experts, and cooperation with law enforcement. We released a preliminary public \nstatement on December 28, 2017 describing the situation and our initial response.\n\nFrom our initial investigation findings, criminals deployed RAM-scraping malware on a \nnumber of our point-of-sales (POS) terminals at various corporate-owned Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurants \n(see Appendix A for a list) starting on June 8, 2017. During the course of the investigation, our \nresponse  team  contained  the  security  breach  and  has  also  disabled  the  malware  in  all of  the \nlocations where it was discovered.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved?\n\nBased on the facts known to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli at this time, we believe that the criminals used \nthe malware to obtain payment card information off of the POS terminals beginning on June 8,\n2017.  Our  investigation  has  determined  that  approximately  2  million unique  payment  card \nnumbers may have been impacted. Specifically, the payment card information obtained was full \ntrack data from a payment card\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic stripe. While this information varies from card issuer \nto card issuer, full track data can include the following: cardholder name, credit or debit card \nnumber, expiration date, cardholder verification value, and service code. However, it should be \nnoted that the cardholder verification value that may have been compromised is not the same as \nthe three-digit value printed on the back of certain payment cards (e.g., Discover, MasterCard, and \nVisa) or the four-digit value printed on the front of other payment cards (e.g., American Express).\nIn addition, the track data does not include personal identification numbers (\xe2\x80\x9cPINs\xe2\x80\x9d) associated \nwith debit cards.\n\nWhat Are We Doing?\n\nSince the breach was discovered, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli has worked closely with third-party forensics \nand cyber security firms, as well as federal law enforcement, to investigate and contain the breach. \n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\n\x0c\x0cDeli Management, Inc.\nNotice of a Data Breach\n\ninformation  about  the  steps  you  can  take  to  avoid  identity  theft  from  the  Attorney  General\xe2\x80\x99s \nwebsite: www.oag.state.md.us.\n\nFor Massachusetts and Rhode Island Residents: \n\n(cid:120) Under Massachusetts and Rhode Island laws, you have the right to obtain a copy of any \n\npolice report.\n\n(cid:120) Security Freeze: Massachusetts and Rhode Island laws also allow consumers to request a \nsecurity freeze.

You  may  submit  a \ndeclaration of removal to remove information placed in your credit report as a result of \nbeing a victim of identity theft.  You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit \nreport or submit a declaration of removal pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity \nSecurity Act.  \n\n(cid:120) The  security  freeze  will  prohibit  a  consumer  reporting  agency  from  releasing  any \n\ninformation in your credit report without your express authorization or approval. \n\n(cid:120) The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved \nin your name without your consent.

As of September 1, 2008, a consumer reporting agency shall \ncomply  with  the  request  within  fifteen  minutes  of  receiving  the  request  by  a  secure \nelectronic method or by telephone.  \n\n(cid:120) A security freeze does not apply in all circumstances, such as where you have an existing \naccount relationship and a copy of your credit report is requested by your existing creditor \n\n\x0cDeli Management, Inc.\nNotice of a Data Breach\n\n(cid:120)\n\nor  its  agents  for  certain  types  of  account  review,  collection,  fraud    control  or  similar \nactivities;  for  use  in  setting  or  adjusting  an  insurance  rate  or  claim  or  insurance \nunderwriting;  for  certain  governmental  purposes;  and  for  purposes  of  prescreening  as \ndefined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.  \nIf you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone or insurance account, you \nshould understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your \nown applications for credit.  You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either completely if \nyou are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, with enough advance notice \nbefore you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect.  You should contact a consumer \nreporting agency and request it to lift the freeze at least three business days before applying.  \nAs of September 1, 2008, if you contact a consumer reporting agency by a secure electronic \nmethod or by telephone, the consumer reporting agency should lift the freeze within fifteen \nminutes.

A  fraud alert can  make it more difficult for someone to  get credit in  your name \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your \nability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three \nnationwide consumer reporting agencies. Contact information for each of the three credit \nreporting agencies is provided above.\n\n(cid:120) As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then \nalso must place fraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. \nAn initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended \nalert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven years. To place either of \nthese alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of \nyour identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended \nalert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a \ncopy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and \nadditional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more \ndetailed information about the identity theft report, visit http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft.\n\n(cid:120) You may also obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and \nensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to \nplace a security freeze on your credit report pursuant to West Virginia law. The security \n\n\x0cDeli Management, Inc.\nNotice of a Data Breach\n\nfreeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your \ncredit report without your express authorization or approval.\n\n(cid:120) The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved \nin your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, \nwithin five business days you will be provided a unique PIN or password to use if you \nchoose  to  remove  the  freeze  on  your  credit  report  or  to  temporarily  authorize  the \ndistribution of your credit report for a period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide \nthat authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the \nfollowing:\n\n1. The unique PIN or password provided by the consumer reporting agency;\n2. Proper identification to verify your identity; and\n3. The period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit \n\n(cid:120) A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a \nfreeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days \nafter receiving the request.\n\n(cid:120) A security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account \nrelationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents \nor  affiliates  for  certain  types  of  account  review,  collection,  fraud  control  or  similar \nactivities.\nIf you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in \nlifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. We advise that you plan \nahead and lift a freeze, either completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a \ncertain creditor, several days before actually applying for new credit.\n\n(cid:120)\n\nreport.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nPlease contact Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli at 350 Pine Street, Suite 1775, Beaumont, TX 77701, email \ncustomer.service@jasonsdeli.com, or call 409-838-1976, Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm \nCST.\n\n\x0cBelow is a list of Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli locations potentially affected by the security breach. \n\nAppendix A\n\nAddress\n583 Brookwood Village\n4700 U.S. 280\n3032 John Hawkins Pkwy\n3756 Airport Blvd\n1520 Eastern Blvd\n2300 McFarland Blvd\n7230 West Ray Rd\n1065 E Baseline Rd\n10217 N Metro Ctr Pkwy\n10605 N Scottsdale Rd\n4545 N Oracle Rd\n6061 E Broadway Blvd\n303 E Altamonte Dr\n870 N Congress Ave\n6791 West Newberry Rd\n4375 South Blvd\n3887 West Lake Mary Blvd\n1509 West New Haven Ave\n2915 E Colonial Dr\n25 W Crystal Lake St\n14531 SW 5th St\n1540 Airport Blvd\n1361 South University Drive\n2335 Apalachee Parkway\n\nCity\nBirmingham\nHoover\nHoover\nMobile\nMontgomery\nTuscaloosa\nChandler\nGilbert\nPhoenix\nScottsdale\nTucson\nTucson\nAltamonte Springs\nBoynton Beach\nGainesville\nJacksonville Beach\nLake Mary\nMelbourne\nOrlando\nOrlando\nPembroke Pines\nPensacola\nPlantation\nTallahassee\n\nState\nAL\nAL\nAL\nAL\nAL\nAL\nAZ\nAZ\nAZ\nAZ\nAZ\nAZ\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\nFL\n\n\x0c7300 North Point Pkwy\n3070 Winward Plaza\n140 Alps Rd\n230 Tenth St\n3755 Carmia Dr SW\n1109 Cumberland Mall\n3330 Piedmont Rd NE\n4705 Ashford Dunwoody Rd\n2907 Washington Road, Bldg 500\n5555 Whittlesey Blvd\n11720 Medlock Bridge Rd\n945 Ernest W.

We sincerely apologize for this incident and want you to know that we take our responsibility of \nprotecting your information very seriously.  This letter contains details about this incident, steps you can take to protect \nyour personal information and resources we are making available to help you. \n \nWhat happened: \n\nOn November 14, 2017, we discovered suspicious activity involving an employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account. We immediately \nengaged independent computer forensic experts to assist with investigating this matter.  On November 30, 2017, the \nforensic investigation determined that an unauthorized user appeared to have gained access to email accounts of three \nemployees. A detailed review of the impacted e-mail accounts was performed and on January 8, 2018, we determined \nthat the emails in those e-mail accounts contained your name and Social Security number and may have potentially \ncontained  your  address,  medication  and  clinical  information,  and  health  insurance  information.

Therefore credit monitoring may not be applicable at this time. All other services provided in the \nmembership will apply. No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you, please follow \nthe instructions below to place the alert. \n \n1.  Website  and  Enrollment.  Go  to  https://ide.myidcare.com/onco360caremed  and  follow  the  instructions  for \nenrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter. Once you have completed your enrollment, \nyou will receive a welcome letter by email (or by mail if you do not provide an email address when you sign up). The \nwelcome  letter  will  direct  you  to  the  exclusive  MyIDCare  Member  Website  where  you  will  find  other  valuable \neducational information.  \n \n2.

Contact MyIDCare at (800) 761-7902 to gain additional information about this event and speak with \nknowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity. \n \n4.  Review  your  credit  reports.  We  recommend  that  you  remain  vigilant  by  reviewing  account  statements  and \nmonitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit \nreport  from  each  of  the  three  major  credit  reporting  companies.  To  obtain  a  free  annual  credit  report,  go  to \nwww.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free \nreport by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.  \n \nIf you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by visiting \ntheir Member website and filing a theft report.  \n \nIf you file a theft report with MyIDCare, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you \ndetermine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence \nof this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse \nthe damage quickly.  \n\nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note \nthat in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to \nprovide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. \nYou can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.  \n\n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this \nafter activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone \nand  also  via  Experian\xe2\x80\x99s  or  Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s  website.  A  fraud  alert  tells  creditors  to  follow  certain  procedures,  including \ncontacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud \nalert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three \nbureaus is as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\x0c \n \n \n \nCredit Bureaus  \n\nEquifax Fraud Reporting \n1-800-525-6285 \nP.O.

Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19022-2000 \nwww.transunion.com  \n\nIt is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three \nbureaus confirms  your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive \nconfirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.  \n  \n6.  Security  Freeze.  By  placing  a  security  freeze,  someone  who  fraudulently  acquires  your  personal  identifying \ninformation will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will \nneed to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that \nwhen you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until \nyou temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live in and \nfor each credit reporting bureau. The Credit Bureau may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze, lift, or remove a \nfreeze. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement agency or \nsubmitted  an  ID  Theft  Complaint  Form  with  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  there  may  be  no  charge  to  place  the \nfreeze.  \n \n7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following \nagencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused \nto file a complaint with them. \n \nCalifornia  Residents:  Visit  the  California  Office  of  Privacy  Protection  (www.privacy.ca.gov)  for  additional \ninformation on protection against identity theft.  \n \nKentucky  Residents:  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  Kentucky,  700  Capitol  Avenue,  Suite  118  Frankfort, \nKentucky 40601, www.ag.ky.gov, Telephone: 1-502-696-5300. \n \nMaryland Residents: Office of the Attorney General of Maryland, Consumer Protection Division 200 St. Paul Place \nBaltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us/Consumer, Telephone: 1-888-743-0023.  \n \nNorth Carolina Residents: Office of the Attorney General of North Carolina, 9001 Mail Service Center \nRaleigh, NC 27699-9001, www.ncdoj.com/, Telephone: 1-919-716-6400. \n \nOregon  Residents:  Oregon  Department  of  Justice,  1162  Court  Street  NE,  Salem,  OR  97301-4096, \nwww.doj.state.or.us/, Telephone: 877-877-9392 \n \nRhode Island Residents: Office of the Attorney General, 150 South Main Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, \nwww.riag.ri.gov, Telephone: 401-274-4400 \n \nAll  US  Residents:  Identity  Theft  Clearinghouse,  Federal  Trade  Commission,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, www.consumer.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), TTY: 1-866-653-4261. \n \n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nC/O ID Experts \nP.O.

Contact MyIDCare at (800) 761-7902 to gain additional information about this event and speak with \nknowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity. \n \n4.  Review  your  credit  reports.  We  recommend  that  you  remain  vigilant  by  reviewing  account  statements  and \nmonitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit \nreport  from  each  of  the  three  major  credit  reporting  companies.  To  obtain  a  free  annual  credit  report,  go  to \nwww.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free \nreport by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.  \n \nIf you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by visiting \ntheir Member website and filing a theft report.  \n \nIf you file a theft report with MyIDCare, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you \ndetermine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence \nof this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse \nthe damage quickly.  \n\nYou should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note \nthat in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to \nprovide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. \nYou can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.  \n\n5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this \nafter activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone \nand  also  via  Experian\xe2\x80\x99s  or  Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s  website.  A  fraud  alert  tells  creditors  to  follow  certain  procedures,  including \ncontacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud \nalert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three \nbureaus is as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\x0c \n \n \n \nCredit Bureaus  \n\nEquifax Fraud Reporting \n1-800-525-6285 \nP.O. Box 105069  \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \nwww.alerts.equifax.com  \n\nExperian Fraud Reporting \n1-888-397-3742 \nP.O. Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013 \nwww.experian.com \n \n\nTransUnion Fraud Reporting \n1-800-680-7289 \nP.O. Box 2000 \nChester, PA 19022-2000 \nwww.transunion.com  \n\nIt is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three \nbureaus confirms  your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive \nconfirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.  \n  \n6.  Security  Freeze.  By  placing  a  security  freeze,  someone  who  fraudulently  acquires  your  personal  identifying \ninformation will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will \nneed to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that \nwhen you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until \nyou temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live in and \nfor each credit reporting bureau. The Credit Bureau may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze, lift, or remove a \nfreeze. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement agency or \nsubmitted  an  ID  Theft  Complaint  Form  with  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  there  may  be  no  charge  to  place  the \nfreeze.  \n \n7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following \nagencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused \nto file a complaint with them. \n \nCalifornia  Residents:  Visit  the  California  Office  of  Privacy  Protection  (www.privacy.ca.gov)  for  additional \ninformation on protection against identity theft.  \n \nKentucky  Residents:  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  Kentucky,  700  Capitol  Avenue,  Suite  118  Frankfort, \nKentucky 40601, www.ag.ky.gov, Telephone: 1-502-696-5300. \n \nMaryland Residents: Office of the Attorney General of Maryland, Consumer Protection Division 200 St. Paul Place \nBaltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us/Consumer, Telephone: 1-888-743-0023.  \n \nNorth Carolina Residents: Office of the Attorney General of North Carolina, 9001 Mail Service Center \nRaleigh, NC 27699-9001, www.ncdoj.com/, Telephone: 1-919-716-6400. \n \nOregon  Residents:  Oregon  Department  of  Justice,  1162  Court  Street  NE,  Salem,  OR  97301-4096, \nwww.doj.state.or.us/, Telephone: 877-877-9392 \n \nRhode Island Residents: Office of the Attorney General, 150 South Main Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, \nwww.riag.ri.gov, Telephone: 401-274-4400 \n \nAll  US  Residents:  Identity  Theft  Clearinghouse,  Federal  Trade  Commission,  600  Pennsylvania  Avenue,  NW \nWashington, DC 20580, www.consumer.gov/idtheft, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), TTY: 1-866-653-4261. \n \n \n\n \n\n\x0c'",https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2018/01/12/pharmerica-corporation-sbn-consumers/,Vermont

To order your free credit \nreport, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major \ncredit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.\n\nFraud Alerts.  At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts \ncreditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit \nwhile the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified \nto place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding \nyour credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:\n\nEquifax\n\nP.O.

A security freeze prohibits a credit \nbureau from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. \nHowever, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent \nthe  timely  approval  of  any  requests  you  make  for  new  loans,  credit  mortgages,  employment,  housing,  or  other \nservices. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it \ncannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge you a fee to \nplace, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze.  Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly \nrange from $3 to $15.  You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus \nlisted above if you wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will \nneed to supply your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to \nfive previous years, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility \nbill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence.

SAMPLE\n1234 MAIN STREET\nANYTOWN US 12345-6789\n\nRE: Notice of Data Breach\n\nDear John Sample:\n\nJanuary 5, 2018\n\nRea.deeming Beauty, Inc. dba beautyblender (\xe2\x80\x9cbeautyblender\xe2\x80\x9d) is writing regarding a recent data\nsecurity  incident  that  may  impact  certain  payment  card  information  used  by  you  to  make\npurchases on our website.  We wanted to provide you with information about this incident, our\nresponse and steps you can take to prevent fraud, should you feel it necessary to do so.\n\nWhat Happened?  Beautyblender was recently contacted by two customers reporting fraud on\ncredit  cards  used  to  make  purchases  on  our  site.    We  immediately  launched  an  internal\ninvestigation  and  contacted  our  website  hosting  company.    The  website  hosting  company\ndiscovered what it believed was a form of malicious code on our site on October 26, 2017 which\nit  then  removed.    A  third  party  forensic  investigator  was  also  retained  to  assist  with  our\ninvestigation.    On  November  27,  2017,  the  forensic  investigator  confirmed  that  the  malware\ninserted  into  our  website  collected  certain  payment  card  information  used  at  checkout.    The\nforensic  investigator  then  began  efforts  to  determine  when  the  malware  was  placed  on  our\nwebsite.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of backups of our website that were available from our\nwebsite hosting company, we have been unable to confirm the date that the malware was placed\non our website.\n\nThe forensic investigator confirmed that the malware was in place as of July 28, 2017.  The next\nmost  recent  backup  available  was  from  April  23,  2015  which  did  not  have  evidence  of  the\nmalware.  While we do not believe the malware was present during this full time period, we have\nno contrary evidence and are using this time period in an abundance of caution.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved?  Because we have been unable to confirm the date that the\nmalware  was  placed  on  our  website,  we  are  notifying  all  customers  who  entered  payment  card\ninformation  on  our  website  between  April  23,  2015  and  October  26,  2017.    The  data  elements\npotentially  subject  to  unauthorized  access  include  your:  name,  address,  phone  number,  email\naddress and credit and/or debit card information.\n\n(cid:128)(cid:44)(cid:65)(cid:38)(cid:113)(cid:7)(cid:65)(cid:25)(cid:67)(cid:17)(cid:94)(cid:41)(cid:94)(cid:17)(cid:77)(cid:9)(cid:83)(cid:43)\n(cid:128)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:122)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:98)(cid:33)(cid:45)(cid:77)(cid:72)(cid:59)(cid:1)(cid:42)(cid:100)(cid:42)(cid:61)(cid:86)\n(cid:121)(cid:9)(cid:57)(cid:41)(cid:89)(cid:41)(cid:121)(cid:9)(cid:121)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:9)(cid:121)(cid:73)(cid:25)(cid:41)(cid:57)(cid:41)\n\n01-02-2-00\n\n \n\n\x0cWhat We  Are  Doing.   We  take  the  security  of  your  personal  information  very  seriously.   We\nhave removed the infected code that led to the vulnerability and implemented additional security\nmeasures  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  a  similar  incident  from  happening  in  the  future.

You  can  stay  vigilant  by  reviewing  your  credit  card  statements  for  any\nsuspicious  charges.    You  can  also  review  the  enclosed  Steps  You  Can  Take  to  Protect  Against\nIdentity Theft and Fraud which includes guidance on steps you can take to better protect against\nthe possibility of fraud and identify theft.\n\nFor More Information.

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report\nonce every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. Contact information for these\nagencies is as follows:\n\nEquifax: P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285\n\nExperian: P.O.

To do so, please visit\nwww.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-887-322-8228.\n\nYou can also order your free annual credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available\nfrom the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to:\nAnnual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

You must contact each of the credit reporting agencies directly to obtain such additional report(s).\n\nFraud Alert. You may place a fraud alert in your file by contacting one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies\nlisted above. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you before they open any new\naccounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you\nwhen you seek to obtain credit.\n\nSecurity Freeze. You have the ability to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze will prevent new\ncredit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that will be issued to you when you initiate the\nfreeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent.\nAs a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a\nsecurity freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. To place a security freeze, you may be required to\nprovide the credit reporting agency certain identifying information, including your full name; Social Security number; date\nof birth; current and previous addresses; a copy of your state-issued identification card; and a recent utility bill, bank\nstatement, or insurance statement.\n\nFor Massachusetts and Rhode Island residents: The consumer reporting agencies may require you to pay a\nfee to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. For Massachusetts residents, such fee may be up to $5.\n\nFederal Trade Commission and State Attorneys General Offices. If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or\nhave reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade\nCommission and/or the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office in your home state.

We are providing this notice \nas a precaution to inform potentially affected individuals about the incident and to call your attention to some steps \nyou can take to help protect yourself. We sincerely regret any concern this may cause you. \nWhat Happened\nWe  were  recently  alerted  to  a  potential  security  incident  affecting  our  website,  www.AmazingGrass.com.  \nWe promptly began investigating this matter and engaged an independent forensic computer firm to help us determine \nwhat may have happened. Based on the forensic firm\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, we believe that an unauthorized individual gained \nthe ability to install malicious code designed to capture payment card information on certain pages of our website.\nWhat Information Was Involved\nThis incident may have affected certain online order information entered by our customers between September 11, 2017 \nand November 3, 2017, including name, address, email address, telephone number, order information, payment card \naccount number, expiration date and card verification number. According to our records, you made or attempted to make \na payment card transaction during this period so it is possible that you were affected. Please note, Amazing Grass does \nnot collect sensitive information like Social Security numbers from our customers, so that information was not affected \nby this incident.\nWhat We Are Doing\nWe take the privacy of personal information seriously, and deeply regret that this incident occurred. We took steps to \naddress this incident promptly after we were alerted to it. We engaged an outside forensic computer firm to assist in \nour investigation of the incident and ensured that the malicious script was removed from our website and the incident \nhad been contained. We also reported this matter to federal law enforcement and will cooperate in their investigation. \nTo help prevent an incident like this from recurring in the future, we have worked with our website hosting provider \nto update and enhance the security of the Amazing Grass website. \nWe have also engaged a leading identity protection services company to provide twelve months of identity monitoring \nservices related to protecting payment card information at no cost to you. More information about these services and \ninstructions on enrolling are included with this letter in the enclosed \xe2\x80\x9cInformation About Identity Theft Protection\xe2\x80\x9d \nreference guide.\n\nT5391 v.02 11.27.2017\n\n\x0cWhat You Can Do\nYou can carefully review credit and debit card account statements as soon as possible in order to determine if there \nare any discrepancies or unusual activity listed. We urge you to remain vigilant and continue to monitor statements \nfor unusual activity going forward. If you see anything you do not recognize, you should immediately notify the \nissuer of the credit or debit card as well as the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, \nyour state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d). In instances of payment card fraud, \nit is important to note that cardholders are typically not responsible for any fraudulent activity that is reported in a \ntimely fashion.\nAlthough Social security numbers were not at risk in this incident, as a general practice you can carefully check \nyour credit reports for accounts you did not open or for inquiries from creditors you did not initiate. If you see \nanything you do not understand, call the credit agency immediately. As an additional precaution, we are providing \ninformation and resources to help individuals protect their identities. This includes an \xe2\x80\x9cInformation About Identity \nTheft Protection\xe2\x80\x9d reference guide, enclosed here, which describes additional steps you may take to help protect \nyourself, including recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and \ninstructions for enrolling in a complimentary one-year membership in identity monitoring services from Experian.\nFor More Information\nFor more information about this incident or if you have additional questions or concerns, you may contact us toll free \nat 866-274-4371 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, or between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. \nEastern Time, Saturday through Sunday.

Box 105281, \nAtlanta, GA, 30348-5281. You may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit \nreporting agencies listed at the bottom of this guide.\nRemain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report any suspicious \nactivity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney \ngeneral, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d). You may contact the FTC or your state\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority to obtain \nadditional information about avoiding and protection against identity theft: Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center \n600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft. \n\nFor residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the \nMaryland Office of the Attorney General: Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division, \n200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us\nFor residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from \nNorth Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office: North Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, Consumer Protection Division, \n9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-877-5-NO-SCAM, www.ncdoj.gov.\nFor residents of Rhode Island You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the \nRhode Island Office of the Attorney General: Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Unit, \n150 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02903, 401-274-4400, http://www.riag.ri.gov.\n\nFraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your \ncredit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit \n\n* Identity theft insurance is underwritten by insurance company subsidiaries or affiliates of American International Group, Inc. (AIG). The description \nherein is a summary and intended for informational purposes only and does not include all terms, conditions and exclusions of the policies described. \nPlease refer to the actual policies for terms, conditions, and exclusions of coverage. Coverage may not be available in all jurisdictions.\n\nT5393 v.02 11.27.2017\n\n\x0creport for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of \nidentity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You \ncan place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or \ntoll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page.\nCredit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no \nnew credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit \nfreeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a \ncredit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily \nlift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, \nlift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and \nremoving a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud \nalert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for \nhow to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified \nbelow to find out more information.\nNew Mexico Consumers Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze or Submit a Declaration of Removal. You may obtain \na security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your \nknowledge. You may submit a declaration of removal to remove information placed in your credit report as a result of being \na victim of identity theft. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report or submit a declaration of removal \npursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act.The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency \nfrom releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval. The security freeze is \ndesigned to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a \nsecurity freeze on your credit report, you will be provided with a personal identification number, password or similar device \nto use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report \nto a specific party or parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To remove the freeze or to provide \nauthorization for the temporary release of your credit report, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all \nof the following:\n\n(1)  the unique personal identification number, password or similar device provided by the consumer reporting agency;\n(2)  proper identification to verify your identity;\n(3)  information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report or the period of time for which \n(4)  payment of a fee, if applicable.\n\nthe credit report may be released to users of the credit report; and\n\nA consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze on a credit report shall comply \nwith the request no later than three business days after receiving the request. As of September 1, 2008, a consumer reporting \nagency shall comply with the request within fifteen minutes of receiving the request by a secure electronic method or by telephone. \nA security freeze does not apply in all circumstances, such as where you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your \ncredit report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control or \nsimilar activities; for use in setting or adjusting an insurance rate or claim or insurance underwriting; for certain governmental \npurposes; and for purposes of prescreening as defined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nIf you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone or insurance account, you should understand that the procedures \ninvolved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either \ncompletely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, with enough advance notice before you apply for new \ncredit for the lifting to take effect. You should contact a consumer reporting agency and request it to lift the freeze at least three \nbusiness days before applying. As of September 1, 2008, if you contact a consumer reporting agency by a secure electronic method \nor by telephone, the consumer reporting agency should lift the freeze within fifteen minutes. You have a right to bring a civil action \nagainst a consumer reporting agency that violates your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act.\nMore Information about Fraud Alerts and Credit Freezes: You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit \nfreezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit reporting agencies listed below.\n\nNational Credit Reporting Agencies Contact Information\n\nEquifax (www.equifax.com)\nGeneral Contact:\nP.O.

We are providing you with information about the incident, steps we are taking in response, and \nsteps you can take to protect against fraud should you feel it is appropriate. \nWhat Happened? On October 6, 2017, while in the process of running routine scans, we identified some unusual \ncode that was running on our website. On that same day, we discovered that we were the victim of a sophisticated \ncyber-attack  that  resulted  in  the  potential  compromise  of  some  customers\xe2\x80\x99  debit  and  credit  card  data  used  at  \nwww.fightgear.com, www.fitness1st.com, www.ringside.com, and www.combatsports.com between July 1, 2015 and \nOctober 6, 2017.\nSince that time, we have been working with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened, what \ninformation was affected and to implement additional procedures to further protect the security of customer debit \nand credit cards. We removed the malware at issue to prevent any further unauthorized access to customer debit or \ncredit card information. You can safely use your payment card at our websites.\nWhat  Information  Was  Involved?  Through  the  ongoing  third-party  forensic  investigations,  we  confirmed  on \nOctober 6, 2017 that malware may have stolen credit or debit card data from some credit and debit cards used at \nwww.fightgear.com,  www.fitness1st.com,  www.ringside.com,  and  www.combatsports.com  between  July  1,  2015 \nand October 6, 2017. The information at risk as a result of this event includes the cardholder\xe2\x80\x99s name, address, card \nnumber, expiration date and CVV. \nWhat We Are Doing. We take the security of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 information extremely seriously, and we apologize for \nthe inconvenience this incident has caused. We continue to work with third-party forensic investigators to ensure the \nsecurity of our systems.\nWhat You Can Do.

Note, however, that because it tells \ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency \nverifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud \nalerts on your file.

(\xe2\x80\x9cBulletproof\xe2\x80\x9d),  we  understand  the  importance of  protecting  the  security  of  your \npayment  card  information  and  have  continually  worked  to  improve  the  security  of  our  system.  Regrettably, \nthis  notice  is  to  inform  you  about  an incident that may have involved your payment card information.  This \nnotice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.   \n\nIn mid-October 2017, Bulletproof identified unauthorized computer code that had been added to the software \nthat  operates  the  checkout  page  at  www.bulletproof.com.    When  we  discovered  the  unauthorized  code,  we \nimmediately  removed  it  and  began  an investigation.   We  have  been  working  with  leading  computer  security \nfirms  to  examine  our systems.  We have also been working with law enforcement.  Based on our investigation, \nwe determined that the unauthorized code may have been capable of capturing information entered during the \ncheckout  process  during  the  period  from  May  20,  2017  through  October  13,  2017  and  October  15-19,  2017.  \nThe information on the checkout page that the code may have accessed includes customers\xe2\x80\x99 names, addresses, \nemail addresses, payment  card numbers,  expiration dates,  and  card security codes (CVV).  You are receiving \nthis notice because your payment card may have been entered on the checkout page during this time period.   \n\nWe take the security of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 personal information very seriously, which is why we have been \nworking  with  leading  computer  security  firms  and  reporting  to  law  enforcement.    We  are  working \ndiligently  to  strengthen  the  security  of  our  website  in  order  to  prevent  this  type  of  incident  from \nhappening again.   \n\nWe  remind  you  to  remain  vigilant  to  the  possibility  of  fraud  by  reviewing  your  payment  card  account \nstatements  for  any  unauthorized  activity.    You  should  immediately  report  any  unauthorized  charges  to \nyour  financial  institution  because  payment  card  network  rules  generally  state  that  cardholders  are  not \nresponsible for fraudulent charges that are timely reported.   \n\nIf you  incurred  costs  that  your  financial  institution  declined  to  reimburse  related  to  fraudulent  charges  on \na  payment card  you  used  for  an  online transaction  with  Bulletproof  during the  relevant  ti me  period,  please \ncontact  us  at the  number below. We will  reimburse you for any such reasonable,  documented  costs that your \nfinancial  institution  declined to pay. \n\nWe regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience.  If you have any questions, please \ncall (844) 534-0816, Monday through Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time. \n\nThank you for your support and loyalty to Bulletproof. \n\nSincerely, \n\n  Dave Asprey \nFounder & CEO\n\n\x0c \n \n \n \n\nMORE INFORMATION ON WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF \n\n \nWe  recommend  that  you  remain  vigilant  for  incidents  of  fraud  or  identity  theft  by  reviewing  your  account \nstatements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on\nyour accounts, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies\nhave rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported. \n\nObtain Your Credit Reports\n\nYou should also monitor your credit reports.  You may periodically obtain free credit reports from each\nnationwide consumer reporting agency.  If you discover inaccurate information or a fraudulent transaction on\nyour credit report, you have the right to request that the consumer reporting agency delete that information\nfrom your credit report file.  \n\nYou have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). These include, among others, the right\nto know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; and to have consumer\nreporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. For more\ninformation about the FCRA, please visit\nwww.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf or www.ftc.gov.\n\nPlace a Fraud Alert or Security Freeze on Your Credit Report File\n\nA fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to\nfollow certain procedures to protect you.  You should know that it also may delay your ability to obtain\ncredit.  You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide consumer\nreporting agencies listed above.  As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other\ntwo agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.  An initial fraud alert will last 90 days.  An\nextended alert stays on your file for seven years.  To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency\nwill require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security\nnumber.  If you ask for an extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report.\n\nA security freeze, sometimes called a credit freeze, is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from\nbeing approved in your name without your consent.  You should know that it also may delay, interfere with,\nor prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment,\nhousing or other services.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file\nby sending a request to each of the three major credit reporting agencies listed above.  When you place a\nsecurity freeze on your credit report, you will be provided with a personal identification number, password,\nor similar device to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize\nthe release of your credit report to a specific party or parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze is\nin place.  In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:\n\n1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);\n2. Social Security number;\n3. Date of birth;\n4.\n\nIf you have moved in the past five (5) years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior five\nyears;\n\n5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill; \n6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\xc2\x92s license or ID card,\n\n0123456\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\nmilitary identification, etc.);\nIf you are a victim of identity theft, a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or\ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft;\nIf you are not a victim of identity theft, payment by check, money order, or credit card (Visa,\nMasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through the mail.\n\n3\n\nD2700-L01\n\n\x0cWith certain exceptions, a consumer reporting agency may charge you a fee to place a freeze on your credit\nreport, to temporarily lift a freeze on your credit report, or to remove a freeze from your credit report.\n\nIF YOU ARE A MARYLAND RESIDENT: \nYou may obtain information about steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the Maryland Attorney\nGeneral\xc2\x92s Office.

Like  many  other  hotels  and  hospitality \ncompanies, Sabre may be used to make reservations at our properties, including information associated \nwith your hotel reservation(s) at one of our hotels booked between August 10, 2016 and March 9, 2017. \nThough the breach was of Sabre, not our systems, we want to provide you with this additional notification \nbeyond what you may have read in the press or received from other parties, out of an abundance of \ncaution. We recommend that you closely review the information provided in this letter for some steps \nthat you may take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your information. \n\nThe enclosed letter from Sabre provides additional explanatory information regarding this incident.   \n\nWhat Happened \n\nSabre facilitates the booking of hotel reservations made by consumers through JRK Hotel Group and other \nhotels,  online  travel  agencies,  and  similar  booking  services.  Following  their  examination  of  forensic \nevidence, Sabre confirmed on or about June 6, 2017 that an unauthorized party gained access to account \ncredentials that permitted unauthorized access to unencrypted payment card information, as well as \ncertain  reservation  information,  for  a  subset  of  all  hotel  reservations  processed  through  Sabre.  The \ninvestigation determined that the unauthorized party first obtained access to payment card and other \nreservation information on August 10, 2016. The last access to payment card information was on March \n9, 2017. \n\nPlease note that the data breach did not involve any systems maintained by our hotels or any information \nyou provided to JRK Hotels.  \n\nWhat Information Was Involved \n\nThe unauthorized party was able to access payment card information in the Sabre system for reservations \nthat  include  your  JRK  Hotel  Group  reservation(s),  including  cardholder  name;  card  number;  card \nexpiration date; and, potentially, card security code. In some cases, the unauthorized party was also able \nto access certain additional hotel reservation information such as guest name, email, phone number, \naddress, and other information. We have been informed by Sabre that information such as Social Security, \npassport, or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license number was not accessed.  \n\n11766 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1500, Los Angeles, California 90025 \n\nTel. 310.268.8344  |  Fax. 310.268.7943 \n\n \n\n\x0cWhat We Are Doing \n\n \n\nSabre engaged a leading cybersecurity firm to support its investigation of the breach of its systems. Sabre \nalso notified law enforcement and the major credit card brands about this incident so they can coordinate \nwith card issuing banks to monitor for fraudulent activity on cards used. We will continue to work with \nthem and provide any cooperation they need to investigate this incident and help protect you.  \n\nWhat You Can Do \n\nAdditional steps you can take to protect yourself from potential identity theft and fraud \n\n1. Remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements \nand monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

Also known as a security freeze, this tool prevents others \nfrom seeing your credit report and credit score unless you decide to lift the freeze. There is a small fee for \nplacing a freeze, and you must contact each of the credit reporting companies separately. In addition, \nplease note that when a freeze is in place you will have to take additional steps before you can apply for \ncredit or permit others\xe2\x80\x94such as prospective landlords\xe2\x80\x94to view your credit report. You will need to lift \nthe freeze temporarily, either for a specific time or for a specific party.  \n\nFor Massachusetts residents, Massachusetts law allows consumers to place a security freeze on their \ncredit reports. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit reporting agency with \na valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a \ncredit reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove \na security freeze.  \n\nIf you are a resident of New Mexico, you have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). \nThese include, among others, the right to know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate \ninformation;  and  to  have  consumer  reporting  agencies  correct  or  delete  inaccurate,  incomplete,  or \nunverifiable \nvisit \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-faircredit-reporting-act.pdff or www.ftc.gov.  \n\nFor  more \n\ninformation. \n\ninformation \n\nplease \n\nabout \n\nFCRA, \n\nthe \n\n11766 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1500, Los Angeles, California 90025 \n\nTel. 310.268.8344  |  Fax. 310.268.7943 \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nIn addition, New Mexico consumers have the right to obtain a security freeze or submit a declaration of \nremoval. You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that \ncredit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You may submit a declaration of removal to \nremove information placed in your credit report as a result of being a victim of identity theft. You have a \nright to place a security freeze on your credit report or submit a declaration of removal pursuant to the \nFair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting \nagency  from  releasing  any  information  in  your  credit  report  without  your  express  authorization  or \napproval. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in \nyour name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, you will be \nprovided  with  a  personal  identification  number,  password,  or  similar  device  to  use  if  you  choose  to \nremove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report to a \nspecific party or parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. \n \nIf you are a resident of Rhode Island, You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect \nyour privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right \nto place a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d on your credit report pursuant to chapter 48 of title 6 of the Identity Theft \nPrevention Act of 2006. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any \ninformation in your credit report without your express authorization or approval. The security freeze is \ndesigned to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. \nWhen you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five (5) business days you will be provided \na personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit \nreport or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report for a specific period of time after the \nfreeze is in place. A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily \nlift a freeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three (3) business days after \nreceiving  the  request.  A  security  freeze  does  not apply  to circumstances where  you  have  an  existing \naccount relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or \naffiliates for certain types of an account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities. If you are \nactively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone, or insurance account, you should understand that \nthe procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should \nplan ahead and lift a freeze -- either completely, if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain \ncreditor -- with enough advance notice before you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect. You \nhave a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting \nlaws. The action can be brought against a consumer reporting agency or a user of your credit report. \nUnless you are sixty-five (65) years of age or older, or you are a victim of identity theft with an incident \nreport or complaint from a law enforcement agency, a consumer reporting agency has the right to charge \nyou  up  to  ten  dollars  ($10.00)  to  place  a  freeze  on  your  credit  report;  up  to  ten  dollars  ($10.00)  to \ntemporarily lift a freeze on your credit report, depending on the circumstances; and up to ten dollars \n($10.00) to remove a freeze from your credit report. If you are sixty-five (65) years of age or older or are \na victim of identity theft with a valid incident report or complaint, you may not be charged a fee by a \nconsumer reporting agency for placing, temporarily lifting, or removing a freeze. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n11766 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1500, Los Angeles, California 90025 \n\nTel. 310.268.8344  |  Fax. 310.268.7943 \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nTo place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three \nmajor consumer reporting agencies by regular, certified or overnight mail: Equifax (www.equifax.com); \nExperian (www.experian.com); and TransUnion (www.transunion.com) at the addresses below: \n\nTrans Union Security Freeze \nFraud Victim Assistance Department \nP.O.

On or about October 18, 2017, we discovered that Saris had become the target of a phishing email \ncampaign and that an employee had clicked on phishing emails and entered their credentials. We immediately took \nsteps to secure the employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account and launched an in-depth investigation to determine whether any sensitive \ninformation was accessed or acquired. \n\nWe subsequently determined, with the help of outside computer forensic investigators, that an unknown actor had \ngained access to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s email account. On October 27, 2017, Saris determined that information related to \ncertain current and former employees was included in the email account and immediately launched a review of our \n\xef\xac\x81les to ascertain address information for the impacted individuals. \n\nWhile we currently have no evidence that anyone accessed or acquired this information, access to the information in \nthe email account cannot be ruled out.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved? While we currently have no evidence that the unauthorized individual or individuals \nactually accessed or acquired your information, we have con\xef\xac\x81rmed that your name, address and Social Security number \nwere accessible to the unknown actor during this event. \n\nWhat We Are Doing. We take the security of information in our care very seriously. Since discovering this event, we \nhave been working diligently with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information \nwas accessible to the unknown actor. This involved a time consuming, programmatic and manual data review process. \nWe are providing notice of this event to you, and to certain regulators and consumer reporting agencies as required.  \nTo help relieve concerns and restore con\xef\xac\x81dence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to \nprovide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year.

As an employee \nof ABM Industries Incorporated or one of its subsidiaries (\xe2\x80\x9cABM\xe2\x80\x9d), you provided ABM with certain personal information, \nand the security of your information is important to us. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your \npersonal information, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you with information about a recent incident, \nsteps we are taking in response, and steps you can take to protect against fraud, should you feel it is appropriate. \n\nWhat Happened? On or about August 1, 2017, we discovered that ABM had become the target of a phishing email \ncampaign. For background, phishing is a type of electronic attack where outside individuals impersonate a trusted \nperson or company to obtain information or install dangerous software. Several ABM employees had clicked on \nthe phishing emails and entered their credentials. As is our protocol, we immediately took steps to secure these \nemployees\xe2\x80\x99 email accounts and launched an in-depth investigation to determine whether any sensitive information \nwas accessed or acquired. \n\nWe subsequently determined, with the help of outside computer forensic investigators, that an unknown actor had \ngained access to certain ABM email accounts. ABM determined, after a programmatic and manual review of the \ncontents of the affected email accounts, the types of protected information contained in the affected email accounts \nand to which individuals the information relates.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved? While we currently have no evidence that the unauthorized individual or individuals \nactually accessed or acquired your information, we have con\xef\xac\x81rmed that your name<<ClientDef1(data elements \naffected)>> accessible within the affected email accounts. \n\nWhat We Are Doing. We take the security of information in our care very seriously. Since discovering this event, we \nhave been working diligently with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information \nwas accessible to the unknown actor. This has involved a programmatic and manual data review process. It is important \nto us to let you know this happened and are providing notice of this event to you, and to certain regulators and consumer \nreporting agencies. \n\nTo help relieve concerns and restore con\xef\xac\x81dence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide \nidentity monitoring at no cost to you for one year.
