We take this crime seriously. It was a crime against Target, our team members and most importantly you -\nour valued guest.\n\nWe understand that a situation like this creates stress and anxiety about the safety of your payment card data at\nTarget.  Our brand has been built on a 50-year foundation of trust with our guests, and we want to assure you that\nthe cause of this issue has been addressed and you can shop with confidence at Target.\n\nWe want you to know a few important things:\n\nThe unauthorized access took place in U.S. Target stores between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, 2013.  Canadian\nstores and target.com were not affected. \nEven if you shopped at Target during this time frame, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you are a victim of fraud. In fact, in\nother similar situations, there are typically low levels of actual fraud.\nThere is no indication that PIN numbers have been compromised on affected bank issued PIN debit cards or\nTarget debit cards. Someone cannot visit an ATM with a fraudulent debit card and withdraw cash.\nYou will not be responsible for fraudulent charges\xe2\x80\x94either your bank or Target have that responsibility.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re working as fast as we can to get you the information you need.  Our guests are always the first priority.\nFor extra assurance, we will offer free credit monitoring services for everyone impacted. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch with\nyou soon on how and where to access the service.\n\nPlease read the full notice below. And over the coming days and weeks we will be relying on target.com,\nabullseyeview.com, corporate.target.com and our various social channels to answer questions and keep you up to\ndate.\n\nThank you for your patience, understanding and loyalty to Target!\n\nGregg Steinhafel Chairman, President and CEO, Target\n\n \n\nThe message below was posted from Target on Dec. 19, 2013\n\nWe wanted to make you aware of unauthorized access to Target payment card data. The unauthorized access may\nimpact guests who made credit or debit card purchases in our U.S. stores from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15, 2013. Your trust\nis a top priority for Target, and we deeply regret the inconvenience this may cause. The privacy and protection of our\nguests\xe2\x80\x99 information is a matter we take very seriously and we have worked swiftly to resolve the incident.\n\nWe began investigating the incident as soon as we learned of it. We have determined that the information involved\nin this incident included customer name, credit or debit card number, and the card\xe2\x80\x99s expiration date and CVV.\n\n1/5\n\n\x0cWe are partnering with a leading third-party forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and to\nexamine additional measures we can take that would be designed to help prevent incidents of this kind in the future.\nAdditionally, Target alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after we discovered and confirmed the\nunauthorized access, and we are putting our full resources behind these efforts.\n\nWe recommend that you closely review the information provided in this letter for some steps that you may take to\nprotect yourself against potential misuse of your credit and debit information. You should remain vigilant for\nincidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit\nreports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect fraud, be sure to report it\nimmediately to your financial institutions. In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d) or law\nenforcement to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity\ntheft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s Web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877)\nIDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania\nAvenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.\n\nYou may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency.  If you discover\ninformation on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting\nagency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal law, you are entitled to one free\ncopy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may\nobtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You\nmay contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:\n\nEquifax\n(800) 525-6285\nP.O. Box 740241\nAtlanta, GA 30374-0241\nwww.equifax.com\n\nExperian\n(888) 397-3742\nP.O. Box 9532\nAllen, TX 75013\nwww.experian.com\n\nTransUnion\n(800) 680-7289\nFraud Victim Assistance Division\nP.O. Box 6790\nFullerton, CA 92834-6790\nwww.transunion.com\n\nIn addition, you may obtain information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and\nsecurity freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud\nalert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain\nprocedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file\nby calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes\nyour fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition,\nyou can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on\nyour credit report to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without your\nprior written authorization.\n\nAgain, we want to stress that we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you. Be assured that\n\n2/5\n\n\x0cwe place a top priority on protecting the security of our guests\xe2\x80\x99 personal information.

If you are the victim of identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report\nand obtain a copy of it.\n\nMassachusetts law also allows consumers to place a security freeze on their credit reports. A security freeze\n\n3/5\n\n\x0cprohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without written\nauthorization.

Del Bianco\n\n3929 Washington Street\nKensington, MD 20895\nPh/fax 301.933.7216\n\nmark@markdelbianco.com\n\nMay 10, 2013\n\nIowa Attorney General\nConsumer Protection Division\nAttn: Sue Kerr\n1305 E. Walnut Street\nDes Moines, IA 50319\n\nRe: Notification of Data Breach\n\nDear Ms. Kerr:\n\nThis letter is being sent on behalf of TerraCom, Inc. (\xe2\x80\x9cTerraCom\xe2\x80\x9d).  It follows up on our \nconversation and emails earlier this week.  Pursuant to the Iowa Open Records Act,  Iowa Code \n\xc2\xa7 22.7 (2012),  TerraCom requests confidential treatment for the entirety of the information \nprovided in this letter.  This letter qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cConfidential Record\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined \nunder several subsections of \xc2\xa7 22.7 of the Iowa Code. The information in this letter qualifies as a \n\xe2\x80\x9ctrade secret\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined in \xc2\xa7 22.7(3)(a) of the Iowa Code.  Moreover, this letter itself \nconstitutes a \xe2\x80\x9creport[] to governmental agencies which, if released, would give advantage to \ncompetitors and serve no public purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Iowa Code \xc2\xa7 22.7(6).  This last section is \nespecially applicable to this letter, and the information contained herein, because TerraCom is \nproviding this information as part of our request for \xe2\x80\x9cconsultation with relevant . . . state, or local \nlaw enforcement agencies\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to Iowa Code \xc2\xa7 715C.2(6) to confirm our conclusion that \nIowa consumers will not be harmed by the data breach we discuss herein.  Therefore, \nTerraComalso requests that at this time the information not be made available for public \ninspection or otherwise disclosed outside the agency staff with a need to know.\n\nOn April 26, 2013,TerraComlearned that it wasthe victim of a security breach involving \nunauthorized access to personal data by an investigative reporter at the Scripps Howard news \norganization.  Thedata was stored on the computer serversof TerraCom\xe2\x80\x99s IT contractor, \nCallCenters India, Inc. d/b/a VCare Corporation (\xe2\x80\x9cVCare\xe2\x80\x9d) and belonged to applicants seeking \nenrollment in the federal Lifeline telephone program administered by the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC). \n\n1\n\n\x0cThe information accessed included names, addresses, social security numbers, and copies of tax \ninformation and other government forms thatTerraComis required by law to obtain and to use to \ndetermine applicant eligibility for the Lifeline program.\n\nUpon learning on April 26 that the computer servers were breached, TerraCominitiated \nimmediate remedial action to secure and protect the compromised data files and further \nsafeguard the personal data of applicants from future attacks by hackers.  TerraCom\nimplemented passwords and additional security measures to restrict access by unauthorized \npersons.  Since then, TerraCom has taken the following additional steps: \n\nRestricted access to applications to employees of TerraCom and other authorized \nindividuals.\n\nAssigned unique usernames and passwords to each application file to prevent \nunauthorized access.\n\nImplemented a session time out process where application information becomes \nunavailable after 15 minutes of viewing.\n\nFrom a longer term perspective, the TerraCom will take the following steps:\n\nEngaging a security expert in Information Technology systems to review and analyze the \nsystem; and \n\nHiring additional in-house security officers to perform regular security audits.\n\nOur initial investigation revealed that persons at various IP addresses associated with Scripps \nHoward gained unauthorized access and downloaded files related to over 150,000\nindividuals.VCare\xe2\x80\x99s computer logs show that approximately 1,683 are residents of Iowa. The \nactual number may be higher than this figure; VCare\xe2\x80\x99s logs only go back to late March, so we \ncannot tell whether Scripps Howard downloaded any applicant files prior to that time.  We have \ncontacted Scripps Howard\xe2\x80\x99s legal counsel.  He has refused to tell us the number of files his \norganization downloaded, but he has pledged that they will not reveal the personal information \nof the affected TerraCom applicants to any third parties.\n\nWe delayed providing this information in order to conduct our investigation and because we \nhadcontacted the FCCto attempt to obtain a decision from the agencyas to whether certain of the \ninformation disclosed may constitute Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).  If so, \nthen federal regulations \xe2\x80\x93 47 C.F.R.\xc2\xa764.2011(b)(1) \xe2\x80\x93 would require us to notify both the FBI and \nthe U.S. Secret Service of the CPNI breach and to wait seven days before providing public notice \nof the breach to the affected individuals.  On May 8, it became clear that the FCC was not going \n\n2\n\n\x0cto provide a definitive answer, so TerraCom is proceeding with notifications to state agencies \nand, where appropriate, individuals.\n\nTo our knowledge, no evidence exists that the breach was a result of a malicious attack on \nTerraCom\xe2\x80\x99s computer systems.  More importantly, given the assurances from Scripps Howard\xe2\x80\x99s \nlegal counsel, we have concluded that no identity theft or other harm has occurred or is likely to \noccur in the future to an applicant as a result of the breach by Scripps Howard.\n\nWhile we are still in the process of determining the full extent of the breach,our investigation has \nalso revealed that the records of a few hundred individuals were accessed one or two at a time \nfrom IP addresses whose owners we cannot confirm at this time.  Three of those individuals \nwhose records were individually accessed were residents ofIowa.\n\nWe will of course be providing notice of the possible breach to those three persons whose \nrecords were individually accessed.  To that end, I am attaching a copy of our proposed notice \nfor your review.  We anticipate sending it to the affected individuals by mail early next week, so \nplease advise me immediately of any changes your office believes are necessary.  We will also \nprovide these applicants whose personal information was put at risk by unidentified third parties \nwith instructions and the opportunity to enroll in a creditbureau monitoring service at \nTerraCom\xe2\x80\x99s expense and at no cost to them. TerraCom will also notify the national credit \nreporting agencies of the breach.\n\nTo assist the applicants whose personal information was accessed, TerraCom has set up a toll-\nfree number (1-855-297-0243) for them to call for information about the breach and about what \nthey should do.\n\nWe have reviewed the applicable Iowa statute, Iowa Code \xc2\xa7 715C.1.  It is our conclusion that \nTerraComisnot required to provide affected Iowa residents with notice of the breach by Scripps \nHoward because ""after an appropriate investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d TerraCom has \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that no \nreasonable likelihood of financial harm to the consumers whose personal information has been \nacquired has resulted or will result from the breach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pursuant to Iowa Code \xc2\xa7 715C.2(6), we are \nsending this letter as a request for \xe2\x80\x9cconsultation with relevant . . . state, or local law enforcement \nagencies\xe2\x80\x9d to confirm that conclusion.\n\nThis is the first time that TerraCom or VCarehas experienced a breach of security.   Security of \npersonal data is the fundamental core of their businesses and they are committed to doing all that \nis possible to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.\n\nTerraComis actively working with an independent digital forensic team to investigate this issue. \nAs this investigation progresses, TerraComwill continue to provide relevant updates to your\nagency regarding this incident andtheir communication with applicants and customers. \n\n3\n\n\x0cIn the meantime, I will be in touch to discuss the timing and procedure of the consultation \nrequested under \xc2\xa7 715C.2(6).  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or \nconcerns.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark C. Del Bianco\n\n4\n\n\x0c'",2013,Iowa

AO recently became aware that AO was the victim of \nunlawful and unauthorized access to the Affected Applications, potentially exposing certain \npersonally identifiable information obtained by AO from individuals who applied for or \npurchased hunting and fishing licenses from the referenced three states as further described in \nthis letter. AO has worked diligently to investigate and resolve this unfortunate situation. This \nletter serves to notify your office of the situation, and to comply with the requirements of Iowa \nCode \xe0\xb8\xa2\xe0\xb8\x87 715C.2(8). \n\nNature of the Unauthorized Access \n\nOn August 22, 2016, AO became aware that it was the victim of an unauthorized and unlawful \naccess to the Affected Applications. All indications are that this threat was isolated to these \nAffected Applications and was limited to accounts created prior to July 2007 for Idaho and \nOregon customers, and prior to July 2006 for Washington customers. AO\'s team took immediate \naction and, within a few hours, launched an extensive investigation in coordination with the \nimpacted states and released updates to its applications to address the potential threat. As an \nadditional protective measure, AO engaged a top-tier cybersecurity firm to conduct an \nindependent comprehensive review. That review confirmed that the incident was successfully \naddressed and that the Affected Applications were secured. \n\nNature of the Information and Number of Affected Iowa Residents \n\nAO\'s investigation has indicated that the information that may have been accessed included the \npersonal information of at least 4,989 Iowa residents, including name, address, date of birth, and \ndriver\'s license number with physical description information. Of that total number, a smaller \nsubset of records included the full Social Security numbers of 3,104 Iowa residents. \n\nMintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. \n\nBOSTON  I  LONDON  I  LOS ANGELES  I  NEW YORK  I  SAN DIEGO  I  SAN FRANCISCO  I  STAMFORD  I  WASHINGTON \n\n\x0cMintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. \n\nDirector of the Consumer Protection Division \nOffice of the Attorney General of Iowa \nSeptember 19, 2016 \nPage 2 \n\nRetnediation Steps \n\nAO has not received any reports of fraud associated with this incident, and is working with the \nimpacted states and law enforcement in their own further investigations. AO is also providing \nnotice to all affected individuals, including Iowa residents, and will be providing 24 months of \nidentity repair and restoration services through AllClear ID at no cost to any affected person. For \nthose individuals whose records included full Social Security numbers, AO will be providing 24 \nmonths of AllClear ID credit monitoring services in addition to identity repair and restoration \nservices, also at no cost to individuals, as described in the sample copies of the notice letters \nattached. Additional security measures have been introduced into the Affected Applications to \nprevent this type of unauthorized access to the system in the future. Further countermeasures \nhave been introduced into the production environment to both prevent access of this nature as \nwell as detect other forms of unauthorized access to these systems. \n\nAO is providing (1) written notice (for affected consumers for which AO has available mailing \naddress), (2) electronic notice (for those affected consumers for which AO has an available email \naddress but no mailing address), (3) statewide media notification via national wire service press \nrelease, and (4) a publicly available website for inquiries at https://activeoutdoors.aficlearid.com   \nalong with a dedicated toll-free call center. Notifications will also be provided to the three major \nconsumer reporting agencies on September 19, 2016. Sample copies of AO\'s notifications to \naffected Iowa residents under Iowa Code \xe0\xb8\xa2\xe0\xb8\x87 715C.2(1) are attached. The notifications will be \nmailed to affected residents on or about September 19, 2016. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at (617) 348-1732 or \nat CJLarose@mintz.com. \n\nVery truly yours, \n\nCynthia J.

Credit freeze laws vary from state to state, The cost of \nplacing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit \nreporting company.

A security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without \nyour consent.

NJSC paid the ransom to unlock the files and notified the New Jersey \noffice of the FBI and NJ State police. We have no reason to believe that any of the information was \nretrieved by the hackers for identify theft purposes, \n\nAppropriate notification letters ore being sent to all affected patients_ pwtiant to The l lealth Information \nTechnology for Economic and Clinical Health (1-WIECH) Act A sample copy of the letter is enclosed. \nMSC will offer complimentaty credit monitoring to all its patients (approximately 2$,000), The Office \nof Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services and credit reporting agencies will also \nbe notified of the incident. \n\nWith regard to the State of Iowa, one (1) individual was notified of the incident. While NJSC is not \nlicensed in the State of Iowa, and does not do business in the state or solicit patients from the state, we are \nnevertheless advising you of this incident. \n\nPlease give me a call at the above telephone number if you have any questions. \n\nMM:ss \n\nGREEI8BERG TRAURIG.

Regrettably, we are writing to inform you we have had a security incident. \n\nOn July 27, 2016, our computer systems were attacked by a malware ransom virus called ""CryptoWall."" The malware \nwas detected by our virus protection software but unfortunately not until after our electronic patient records were \nencrypted. The virus encrypted, thereby rendering unusable, all of our electronic medical record files that contained \nall of the clinical information on our patients such as procedures, office notes, reports, etc. In addition to the medical \ninformation, the records contained demographic information such as date of birth, address, and in some cases SSN, \ncredit card and account information. The virus also encrypted our most recent system backup and even disabled our \nphone system. The individuals demanded that we pay a monetary ransom in order to receive an encryption key to \nunlock the files. Seeing no other option, we elected to pay the ransom to gain access to the records. We notified the \nFBI and local authorities regarding the incident. Unfortunately, these individuals often operate outside of the United \nStates, making detection, identification and prosecution nearly impossible. \n\nThe virus likely utilized a list of stolen passwords and ran an automated program that attempted access until a correct \nmatch was found. \n\nWhile we cannot guarantee that patient personal demographics were not the target for the intrusion, we have no \ninformation that would suggest the attack was an effort to steal patient information. Further, we have no information \nto suggest that any of your medical or financial information was used or acquired by the hackers for any improper \npurpose. \n\nIn an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident and providing you with the option to obtain \ncomplimentary credit monitoring. To further protect yourself, you should be diligent and review your record with \nyour physician at your next appointment to verify your information if anything seems incorrect. \n\nWe have partnered with Equifax\xc2\xae to provide its Credit Watch\' Gold identity theft protection product for one year at \nno charge to you. A description of this product is provided in the attached materials, which also contains instructions \nabout how to enroll (including your personal activation code).

Schwaab recently learned that an unauthorized\nindividual uploaded malicious code to Schwaab's web server. This code allowed the\nindividual to access Schwaab's system. Upon learning of the security incident, Schwaab\nretained highly credentialed PCI forensic experts to investigate and analyze the\nincident. The investigation has been ongoing.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, the investigators released their Final Incident Response Report,\n\nwhich indicated that there was evidence that Schwaab's system had been accessed and\nmalicious code had been uploaded. However, they were unable to find evidence that any\nspecific data was accessed or stolen. Due to the nature of the breach, they do not think they\nwill ever be able to determine what, if any, data was accessed or compromised.\n\nAfter discovering the incident, Schwaab immediately contained the incident and\n\nimplemented additional security protocols to monitor for unusual activity.\n\nDuring the period of time that unauthorized access may have occurred, Schwaab\n\nwas doing business as usual and was processing customer credit card information. Out of\nthe abundance of caution and in the interest of protecting its customers, Schwaab has\n\nW H D/ 12602982.1\n\n33 E. MAIN STREET ~  SU[TE 300 ~  P.O.

Schwaab is also working proactively with the credit card brands, law\nenforcement and others to ensure its customers' information is protected. In fact, Schwaab\ndelayed notification to customers and state governments upon the request of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, who is investigating the incident.\n\nThe total number of consumers in Iowa affected, if any, is unknown as again,\n\nSchwaab has no evidence that any specific information was accessed or stolen. However,\napproximately 829 individuals in Iowa transacted business with Schwaab using a credit\ncard during the period of time a potential intrusion may have occurred. Those individuals\nhave been notified of the breach. Schwaab's customer notification letter form is attached.\n\nIf your office has any questions or would like to discuss this incident further, please\n\ndo not hesitate to contact me directly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMelinda S.

(cid:9)\n\n/ \n\nWe are writing on behalf of our client, Vera Bradley, to notify you of a security incident \n\nthat may have involved the payment card information of Iowa residents. \n\nOn September 15, 2016, Vera Bradley was provided information from law enforcement \nregarding a potential data security issue related to its retail store network. Vera Bradley \nresponded by immediately notifying the payment card networks and initiating an investigation \nwith the assistance of a leading computer security firm to gather facts and determine the scope of \nthe issue. Findings from the investigation show unauthorized access to Vera Bradley\'s payment \nprocessing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data. \n\nThe program was specifically designed to find track data from the magnetic stripe of a \npayment card as the data was being routed through the affected payment systems. Track data in \nthe magnetic stripe of a payment card may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration \ndate, and internal verification code. \n\nSome, but not all, payment cards used at Vera Bradley retail store locations between July \n25, 2016 and September 23, 2016 may have been affected. Cards used on Vera Bradley\'s website \nwere not affected. \n\nVera Bradley has taken significant steps to stop the attack and strengthen the security of \nits network environment, including resetting all enterprise passwords, blocking certain network \ncommunication attempts, and removing affected systems from the network. Since the payment \n\nAtlanta (cid:9)\n\nHouston (cid:9)\n\nChicago (cid:9)\nLos Angeles (cid:9)\n\nCincinnati (cid:9)\nNew York (cid:9)\n\nCleveland (cid:9)\nOrlando (cid:9)\n\nColumbus (cid:9)\nPhiladelphia (cid:9)\n\nCosta Mesa (cid:9)\nSeattle (cid:9) Washington, DC \n\nDenver \n\n\x0cIowa Attorney General \nOctober 12, 2016 \nPage 2 \n\ncard networks have been notified, they can work with the banks that issued payment cards used \nduring the affected time period. Lastly, Vera Bradley has established a dedicated call center that \npotentially affected individuals can call with questions regarding the incident. \n\nVera Bradley is not able to identify the total number of potentially affected Iowa \nresidents, and Vera Bradley cannot identify a name and mailing address for most potentially \naffected residents. Thus, pursuant to Iowa Code Ann. \xc2\xa7715C.2, Vera Bradley is providing \nsubstitute notification today to Iowa residents who used their payment cards at an affected Vera \nBradley retail location during that location\'s affected time frame by posting a statement on its \nwebsite, issuing a press release, and sending an email (to those individuals for whom Vera \nBradley has an email address). The substitute notification, press release and email notice are \nenclosed. Vera Bradley has been able to identify the mailing address of 101 Iowa residents who \nused their payment cards at an affected Vera Bradley retail location. In accordance with Iowa \nCode Ann. \xc2\xa7715C.2, Vera Bradley will be mailing a letter to these individuals. A copy of the \nnotification letter is enclosed. Notification is being provided without unreasonable delay \nfollowing the completion of an investigation by Vera Bradley to determine the scope of the \nincident.

Upon learning \nthis information, we immediately notified the payment card networks and initiated an \ninvestigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm to aggressively gather \nfacts and determine the scope of the issue. \n\nPayment cards used at Vera Bradley retail store locations between July 25, 2016 and \nSeptember 23, 2016 may have been affected. Not all cards used during this time frame \nwere affected. Cards used on our website have not been affected. \n\nFindings from the investigation show unauthorized access to Vera Bradley\'s payment \nprocessing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data. The \nprogram was specifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment \ncard that may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal \nverification code - as the data was being routed through the affected payment systems. \nThere is no indication that other customer information was at risk. \n\nIt is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your \npayment card statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report \nany unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally \nprovide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a \ntimely manner. The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card. \nPlease see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you may take to protect \nyour information. \n\nVera Bradley has stopped this incident, and we continue to work with the computer \nsecurity firm to further strengthen the security of our systems to help prevent this from \nhappening again. \n\nVera Bradley values the relationship we have with our customers and understands the \nimportance of protecting personal information. We regret any inconvenience this may \nhave caused.

You may obtain a copy of \nyour credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit \nreporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit \nwww.annualcreditreport.com   or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228.

You can obtain information from these sources \nabout steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts \nand security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a \npolice report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to \ncreditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as \nfollows: \n\nFederal Trade Commission,  Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTH EFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft  \n\nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your \ncreditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You \nmay ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or \nare about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at \nleast 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already \nbeen a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert \nstays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by \ncontacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies. \nCredit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on \nyour credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number \nthat is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential \ncredit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, \npotential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless \nyou temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain \ncredit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze \nlaws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze \nalso varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud \nalert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting \ncompany. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please \ncontact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information. \n\nIf you are a resident of Maryland, North Carolina, or Rhode Island, you may contact and obtain \ninformation from your state attorney general at: \n\n\x0c\xe2\x80\xa2  Maryland Attorney General\'s Office,  200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, \n\nwww.oag.state.md.tis, 1-888-743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) \n(410) 576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\xe2\x80\xa2  North Carolina Attorney General\'s Office,  9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC \n\n27699, www.ncdoj.gov, 1-919-716-6400 \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Rhode Island Attorney General\'s Office,  150 South Main Street, Providence, RI \n\n02903, www.riag.ri.gov, 401-274-4400 \n\nIf you are a resident of Massachusetts, note that pursuant to Massachusetts law, you have the \nright to file and obtain a copy of any police report. \n\nMassachusetts law also allows consumers to request a security freeze. A security freeze prohibits \na credit reporting agency from releasing any information from your credit report without written \nauthorization. Be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere \nwith, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, \nemployment, housing, or other services. \n\nThe fee for placing a security freeze on a credit report is $5.00.

(Nasdaq: VRA) (""Vera Bradley"" or the \n""Company"") today announced that it has taken action to investigate and address an incident affecting \npayment card data used at its retail stores. \n\nPayment cards used at Vera Bradley store locations between July 25, 2016 and September 23, 2016 may \nhave been affected. Not all cards used in stores during this time frame were affected. Cards used on \nverabradley.com  were not affected. Information on steps customers may take to protect their \ninformation can be found at www.verabradley.com/protectingourcustomers.  \n\nOn September 15, 2016, Vera Bradley was provided information from law enforcement regarding a \npotential data security issue related to our retail store network. Upon learning this information, Vera \nBradley immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm to \naggressively gather facts and determine the scope of the issue and promptly notified the payment card \nnetworks. Findings from the investigation show unauthorized access to Vera Bradley\'s payment \nprocessing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data. The program was \nspecifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment card that may contain the card \nnumber, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal verification code as the data was being routed \nthrough the affected payment systems. There is no indication that other customer information was at \nrisk. \n\nVera Bradley has stopped this incident and continues to work with the computer security firm to further \nstrengthen the security of its systems to help prevent this from happening in the future. Vera Bradley \ncontinues to support law enforcement\'s investigation and is also working with the payment card networks \nso that the banks that issue payment cards can be made aware and initiate heightened monitoring on the \naffected cards. \n\nPotentially affected customers are advised to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by regularly \nreviewing their payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. Customers should immediately \nreport any unauthorized charges to their card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that \ncardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner. The phone \nnumber to call is usually on the back of the payment card. \n\nVera Bradley values the relationship it has with its customers and understands the importance of \nprotecting personal information and therefore sincerely regrets any inconvenience this may have caused \nits customers. If customers have any questions, they may call 844-723-9340 from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. \nEDT, Monday through Friday. \n\n\x0cPage 2 of 2 \n\nAbout Vera Bradley, Inc. \n\nVera Bradley is a leading designer of women\'s handbags, luggage and travel items, fashion and home \naccessories and unique gifts.

You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every \n12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please \nvisit www.annualcreditreport.com   or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit \nreporting companies is as follows: \n\nEquifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111 \nExperian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742 \nTrans Union, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800 \n\nIf you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, \nyou should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General\'s office in your state. You \ncan obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information \nabout fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police \nreport. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your \nrecords. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows: \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580, \n1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft  \n\nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that \nyou may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on \nyour credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already \nbeen a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report \nfor seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting \nagencies. \n\nCredit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that \nno new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a \nfreeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your \nconsent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit \nreport unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In \naddition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The \ncost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each \ncredit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit \nreporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the \nthree major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information. \n\nIf you are a resident of Maryland, North Carolina, or Rhode Island, you may contact and obtain information from \nyour state attorney general at: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Maiyland Attorney General\'s Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.ind.us, 1-888-\n\n743-0023 (toll free when calling within Maryland) \n(410) 576-6300 (for calls originating outside Maryland) \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\xe2\x80\xa2  North Carolina Attorney General\'s Office, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, www.ncdoj.cov, 1-\n\n919-716-6400 \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Rhode Island Attorney General\'s Office, 150 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02903, www.riag.ri.gov, 401-\n\n274-4400 \n\nIf you are a resident of Massachusetts, note that pursuant to Massachusetts law, you have the right to file and obtain a \ncopy of any police report. \n\n2 \n\n\x0cMassachusetts law also allows consumers to request a security freeze. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency \nfrom releasing any information from your credit report without written authorization. Be aware that placing a security \nfreeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new \nloans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. \n\nThe fee for placing a security freeze on a credit report is $5.00. If you are a victim of identity theft and submit a valid \ninvestigative report or complaint with a law enforcement agency, the fee will be waived. In all other instances, a credit \nreporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. If \nyou have not been a victim of identity theft, you will need to include payment to the credit reporting agency to place, lift, \nor remove a security freeze by check, money order, or credit card. \n\nTo place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major reporting \nagencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below: \n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com   \nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com   \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com  \n\nIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n\n1.

(\xe2\x80\x9cEasy  Breathe\xe2\x80\x9d),  located  in  Los  Angeles,  California,  with \nrespect to a recent potential data security incident described in more detail below.  Easy Breathe \ntakes the security and privacy of the information in its control very seriously, and is taking steps \nto prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.  \n\n1. \n\nNature of the security incident.  \n\nOn  February  10,  2017,  Easy  Breathe  learned  that  an  unknown  individual  may  have  accessed \ncustomer  credit  and  debit  card  information  used  to  make  purchases  at  its  online  store.    Easy \nBreathe  immediately  took  action  to  secure  its  system  and  commenced  an  investigation  to \ndetermine  what  information  may  have  been  accessed.    Easy  Breathe  determined  that  the \nunknown  individual  may  have  accessed  customer  payment  card  information,  including  name, \naddress,  telephone  number,  and  credit/debit  card  information.

For residents of Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, and West Virginia: It is required by state laws to inform you that you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, whether or not you suspect any unauthorized activity on your account.  You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the nationwide three credit reporting agencies.  To order your free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com, or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.  You can also order your annual free credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

For residents of all states:  Fraud Alerts: You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian\xe2\x80\x99s or Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s website.  A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.

The contact information for all three credit bureaus is below:  Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.  Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report.  A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent.  To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency.  You may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below.  The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.  The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement.  It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.  The consumer reporting agency may charge a small fee to place, lift, or remove a freeze, but is free if you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the consumer reporting agency.  You may obtain a security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:  Equifax Security Freeze P.O.

We assisted GLCC in identifying and retaining \nthe nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading technical consultants and forensic investigators to determine what happened \nand what information was affected.  Secondly, with the assistance of these professionals, GLCC \nhas been working closely with federal law enforcement to investigate this incident. In connection \nwith third-party cyber security professionals, GLCC continues to monitor its network for any  \nadditional unauthorized intrusions.   \n\n1200 18th Street, NW  |  Suite 700  |  Washington, DC 20036  |  TEL: 202.750.3500  |  FAX: 202.750.3503 \n\n115 E.

Despite considerable investment made in technology to keep our data systems \nsafe and secure, Great Lakes Communication Corporation d/b/a IGL TeleConnect discovered that \nit was the victim of a sophisticated cyber-attack on March 20, 2017, which may have contributed to \nthe network disruptions that occured on April 3, 2107. Our investigation, while ongoing, leads us to \nbelieve that the attacks were performed by a professional hacker who has targeted several other \nbusinesses in the United States.  The hacker utilized custom kernel-level and user-land backdoors to \nobtain access to certain GLCC computing systems.  \nWHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED? Due to this event, the following personal information of our \ncustomers may have been compromised: telecommunications subscriber records, Social Security \nNumbers, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers.\nWHAT ARE WE DOING? As soon as we discovered the problem, we immediately began \nimplementing our data breach security protocols to contain and resolve this issue.   \nFirst, we notified our legal counsel who assisted us in identifying and retaining the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading \ntechnical consultants and forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information \nwas affected.  Secondly, with the assistance of these professionals, we have been working closely \nwith federal law enforcement to investigate this incident.  Rest assured that IGL TeleConnect will \ncooperate with law enforcement to the fullest extent possible in order to bring these criminals to \njustice. \nIn connection with third-party cyber security professionals, we continue to monitor our network for any \nadditional unauthorized intrusions.  After consultation with law enforcement, we have concluded that \nwe can now provide this notice to affected customer without jeopardizing the on-going investigation. \nWe understand that the safety and security of your personal information is of utmost importance and \napologize for the inconvenience that this breach causes to each of our valued customers.  \nIn order to address the inconvenience, and to protect each of our customers, we will pay \nfor each of our customers to obtain LifeLock\xe2\x80\x99s identity theft protection service, which is a \nproactive, alert based, solution designed to detect fraudulent applications so that they can be \nstopped before a credit profile is affected. \n\n[OVER]\n\nExhibit A\x0c.  Your Partner/Promo \n\n.  Your membership ID will be your first and last name plus your zip code \n\nWe encourage you to enroll for this service today by following these instructions:\n1)  Go to https://store.lifelock.com/enrollment?promocode=\ncode is \n(Example: JOHNDOE51301).\n2)  Continue entering your personal information. \nYou can also call LifeLock at (800) 899-0180 and speak with a live agent 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek.  Please note that you have until June 21, 2017 to enroll.\nWHAT OTHER THINGS SHOULD YOU DO? In addition to subscribing to the LifeLock service, we \nrecommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit files.  A fraud alert tells creditors to contact \nyou before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. To place a fraud alert \non your credit files: Call any of the three major credit bureaus below.  As soon as one credit bureau \nconfirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts.  The initial fraud alert stays on \nyour credit report for 90 days.  You can renew it after 90 days.  The contact information of the three \nmajor credit bureaus are the following:\nEquifax:  equifax.com or 1-800-525-6285\nExperian:  experian.com or 1-888-397-3742\nTransUnion:  transunion.com or 1-800-680-7289\nYou may also request that all three credit-reporting agencies send you a copy of your creditor \nreport for your review.  Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically.  \nChecking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.\nIf you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being \nmisused, file a police report, notify the Iowa Attorney General or report it to other law enforcement \nagencies.  Get a copy of the police report or confirmation document; you may need it to clear up \nfraudulent debts.\nIf your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s site at www.IdentityTheft.gov to get \nrecovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint.  Your complaint will be added to the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s \nConsumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.\nYou also may want to consider contacting the major credit bureaus at the telephone numbers above \nto place a credit freeze on your credit file.  A credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your \ncredit report.  That makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name.\nYou can also contact the IRS identity Protection Specialized Unit at 1-800-908-4490 for more \ninformation.\nContact For More Information:  In case you need more information on this incident, what we are \ndoing and what you can do to protect your personal information, please call us at 712-260-6204.\n\nKellie Beneke\nPresident\nGreat Lakes Communication Corp.\n\n\x0c'",04/06/17,Iowa

Walnut Street \nDes Moines, Iowa 50319 \n\nRe: \n\n   \n\nIncident Notification \n\nDear Sir or Madam: \n\nCraig A. Hoffman \ndirect dial: 513.929.3491 \ncahoffman@bakerlaw.com \n\n \n\n \nOur  client  is  Six  Continents  Hotels,  Inc.  which  is  an  InterContinental  Hotels  Group \nCompany  (\xe2\x80\x9cIHG\xe2\x80\x9d).  Most  IHG-branded  locations  are  independently  owned  and  operated  by \nseparate entities that have a franchise license from IHG.  IHG is submitting this notification on \nbehalf of certain  franchisees that operated locations in  the Americas.  After several  franchisees \nwere made aware in January 2017 by payment card networks of patterns of unauthorized charges \noccurring  on  payment  cards  after  they  were  legitimately  used  at  their  locations  and  reported \nthose  notices  to  IHG,  to  ensure  an  efficient  and  effective  response,  IHG  hired  a  leading  cyber \nsecurity  firm  on  behalf  of  franchisees  to  coordinate  an  examination  of  the  payment  card \nprocessing systems of franchise hotel locations in the Americas region.   \n\n \nThe  investigation  identified  signs  of  the  operation  of  malware  designed  to  access \npayment  card  data  from  cards  used  onsite  at  the  front  desk  at  certain  IHG-branded  franchise \nhotel  locations  in  the  Americas  between  September  29,  2016  and  December  29,  2016.    The \nmalware  searched  for  track  data  (which  sometimes  has  cardholder  name  in  addition  to  card \nnumber,  expiration  date,  and  internal  verification  code)  read  from  the  magnetic  stripe  of  a \npayment card as it was being routed through the affected hotel server.  There is no indication that \nother guest information was affected.  Before this incident began, many IHG-branded franchise \nhotel  locations  had  implemented  IHG\xe2\x80\x99s  Secure  Payment  Solution  (SPS),  a  point-to-point \nencryption  payment  acceptance  solution.    Properties  that  had  implemented  SPS  before \nSeptember  29,  2016,  were  not  affected.    Many  more  properties  implemented  SPS  after \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\n \nApril 14, 2017 \nPage 2 \n\nSeptember  29,  2016,  and  the  implementation  of  SPS  ended  the  ability  of  the  malware  to  find \npayment  card  data  and,  therefore,  cards  used  at  these  locations  after  SPS  implementation  were \nnot affected. \n\n \nOn behalf of franchisees, beginning today, IHG is mailing a notification letter to 13,449 \nIowa  residents  in  accordance  with  Iowa  Code  \xc2\xa7  715C.2  in  substantially  the  same  form  as  the \nletter  enclosed  hereto.    Also,  pursuant  to  Iowa  Code  \xc2\xa7  715C.2(4)(c),  on  behalf  of  franchisees, \nIHG  is  providing  substitute  notification  today  by  posting  a  statement  on  its  website \n(www.ihg.com/protectingourguests)  and \nthe  homepages  of \nIntercontinental.com, \nHolidayinnresorts.com, \nHolidayinn.com,  Staybridge.com,    and  Candlewoodsuites.com  and  issuing  a  press  release  (a \ncopy  of  the  press  release  and  substitute  notice  are  enclosed).    Notice  is  being  provided  as \nexpeditiously as practicable and without delay. \n\nthe  statement  on \n\nCrowneplaza.com, \n\nHotelindigo.com, \n\nlinks \n\nto \n\n \nIHG  has  established  a  dedicated  call  center  that  potentially  affected  individuals  can \ncontact  with  questions.  IHG is  also  recommending that potentially affected individuals remain \nvigilant  to  the  possibility  of  fraud  by  reviewing  their  account  statements  and  credit  reports  for \nunauthorized activity. \n\nOn behalf of franchisees, IHG has been working closely with the payment card networks \nas  well  as  with  the  cyber  security  firm  to  confirm  that  the  malware  has  been  eradicated  and \nevaluate  ways  for  franchisees  to  enhance  security  measures.    Law  enforcement  has  also  been \nnotified.   \n\n \n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.   \n\nSincerely,  \n\nCraig A.

To ensure an efficient and effective \nresponse, IHG hired a leading cyber security firm on behalf of franchisees to coordinate an examination of the \npayment card processing systems of franchise hotel locations in the Americas region. \n\nThe investigation identified signs of the operation of malware designed to access payment card data from cards \nused onsite at the front desk at certain IHG-branded franchise hotel locations in the Americas* between September \n29, 2016 and December 29, 2016. The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in \naddition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment \ncard as it was being routed through the affected hotel server. There is no indication that other guest information was \naffected. You are being notified because you used payment card(s) ending in <<ClientDef1(Card Number)>> during \nthis time period onsite at the front desk of an affected hotel. A list of affected IHG franchise locations and respective \ntime frames, which may vary by location, is available at www.ihg.com/protectingourguests. \n\nIt is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any \nunauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment \ncard rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely \nmanner. The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card. Please see the section that follows \nthis notice for additional steps you may take.\n\nOn behalf of franchisees, IHG has been working closely with the payment card networks as well as with the cyber \nsecurity firm to confirm that the malware has been eradicated and evaluate ways for franchisees to enhance security \nmeasures. Law enforcement has also been notified. \n\nWe deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

A security freeze prohibits a credit \nreporting agency from releasing any information from your credit report without written authorization. Be \naware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely \napproval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. \nThe fee for placing a security freeze on a credit report is $5.00. If you are a victim of identity theft and submit a \nvalid investigative report or complaint with a law enforcement agency, the fee will be waived. In all other \ninstances, a credit reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place, temporarily lift, or permanently \nremove a security freeze. If you have not been a victim of identity theft, you will need to include payment to \nthe credit reporting agency to place, lift, or remove a security freeze by check, money order, or credit card. \nTo place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major \nreporting agencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below: \n \n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com \nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000, www.transunion.com \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n\x0cIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.) \n2.  Social Security number \n3.  Date of birth \n4. \n\nIf you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior \nfive years \n\n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill \n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\'s license or ID card, \n\n7. \n\nmilitary identification, etc.) \nIf you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or \ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft \n\nThe credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security \nfreeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) \nbusiness days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (""PIN"") or password or both that \ncan be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. \n \nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must \ncall or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name, \naddress, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the \nsecurity freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit \nreport or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have \nthree (3) business days after receiving your request to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for \nthe specified period of time. \n \nTo remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail \nand include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or \npassword provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business \ndays after receiving your request to remove the security freeze. \n\nIf you are a resident of West Virginia, you also have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting \nagencies place ""fraud alerts"" in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of \nidentity theft. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells \ncreditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may \nplace a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. Contact \ninformation for each of the three credit reporting agencies is as follows: \n\nEquifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111 \nExperian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742 \nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289 \n \n\nAs soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud \nalerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays \nin your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven \nyears. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate \nproof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended alert, you will \nhave to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with \na federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\x0cmay require you to submit. For more detailed information about the identity theft report, visit \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft/. \n \nYou may also obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not \ngranted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report \npursuant to West Virginia law. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing \nany information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval. \n \nThe security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without \nyour consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five business days you will be \nprovided a unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password to use if you choose to remove the \nfreeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the distribution of your credit report for a period of \ntime after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting \nagency and provide all of the following: \n\n1.  The unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password provided by the consumer reporting \n\nagency; \n\n2.  Proper identification to verify your identity; and \n3.  The period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report. \n\nA consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit \nreport shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request. \n \nA security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account relationship and a \ncopy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account \nreview, collection, fraud control or similar activities. \n \nIf you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security \nfreeze may slow your own applications for credit.

Many  IHG-branded  locations  are  independently  owned  and \noperated franchises, and certain of these franchisee operated locations in the Americas were made aware by \npayment  card  networks  of  patterns  of  unauthorized  charges  occurring  on  payment  cards  after  they  were \nlegitimately used at their locations.  To ensure an efficient and effective response, IHG hired a leading cyber \nsecurity firm on behalf of franchisees to coordinate an examination of the payment card processing systems of \nfranchise hotel locations in the Americas region.  \n \nThe  investigation  identified  signs  of  the  operation  of  malware  designed  to  access  payment  card  data  from \ncards used onsite at the front desk at certain IHG-branded franchise hotel locations between September 29, \n2016  and  December  29, 2016.    Although  there  is  no  evidence  of  unauthorized  access  to  payment  card  data \nafter  December  29,  2016,  confirmation  that  the  malware  was  eradicated  did  not  occur  until  the  properties \nwere investigated in February and March 2017.  Before this incident began, many IHG-branded franchise hotel \nlocations  had  implemented  IHG\xe2\x80\x99s  Secure  Payment  Solution  (SPS),  a  point-to-point  encryption  payment \nacceptance  solution.    Properties  that  had  implemented  SPS  before  September  29,  2016  were  not  affected.  \nMany more properties implemented SPS after September 29, 2016, and the implementation of SPS ended the \nability  of  the  malware  to  find  payment  card  data  and,  therefore,  cards  used  at  these  locations  after  SPS \nimplementation were not affected.    \n \nThe  malware  searched  for  track  data  (which  sometimes  has  cardholder  name  in  addition  to  card  number, \nexpiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being \nrouted through the affected hotel server. There is no indication that other guest information was affected.  A \nlist  of  affected  franchise  locations  and  respective  time  frames,  which  may  vary  by  location,  is  available  at \nwww.ihg.com/protectingourguests. The site also contains more information on steps guests may take.     \n \nIt is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements \nfor  any  unauthorized  activity.  You  should  immediately  report  any  unauthorized  charges  to  your  card  issuer \nbecause payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges \nreported in a timely manner.  The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.   \n \nOn behalf of  franchisees,  IHG has been working closely with the  payment  card networks as well  as with the \ncyber  security  firm  to  confirm  that  the  malware  has  been  eradicated  and  evaluate  ways  for  franchisees  to \nenhance security measures.  Law enforcement has also been notified. IHG also has established a dedicated call \ncenter to answer any questions affected guests may have.  \n \nFor \nwww.ihg.com/protectingourguests. \n \n\nIHG  website \n\ninformation \n\nadditional \n\nincident, \n\nplease \n\nabout \n\nvisit \n\nthis \n\nthe \n\nat \n\nMedia Contact: \nNeil Hirsch \nneil.hirsch@ihg.com  \n\n### \n\n\x0c'",04/14/17,Iowa

Walnut St. \nDes Moines, IA 50319 \n \n \nDear Attorney General Miller: \n \nWe write on behalf of our client the Gannett Company, Inc. (\xe2\x80\x9cGannett\xe2\x80\x9d) to inform you of a data \nsecurity  incident  involving  the  personal  information  of  certain  current  and  former  Gannett \nemployees and/or their beneficiaries, including approximately 634 Iowa residents. \n \nOn March 30, 2017, Gannett discovered that several members of its human resources department \nwere  victims  of  a  phishing  attack  that  compromised  their  Office  365  account  credentials, \nincluding their Gannett email.  The perpetrator used those credentials to send further phishing \nemails from some of the impacted personnel\xe2\x80\x99s accounts, and also attempted to use an account for \na fraudulent corporate wire transfer request.  This attempt was identified as suspicious and was \nunsuccessful.   \n\nGannett  took  immediate  action  to  lock  down  the  affected  accounts  and  alert  other  Gannett \nemployees  about  the  phishing  email.    Gannett  quickly  disabled  and  isolated  the  impacted \naccounts, and changed the credentials for each impacted employee.  The company conducted a \nforensic investigation to confirm that no other systems were impacted, and that no personal data \nhad been emailed out of the impacted accounts, and reported the incident to the Federal Bureau \nof  Investigation.    Gannett  will  also  continue  to  provide  regular  reminders  and  training  for \nemployees on how to spot and avoid being victimized by phishing emails in the future.   \n\nAt this time, Gannett is not aware of any acquisition of sensitive personal data.  Nevertheless, it \nis providing notice out of an abundance of caution because personal information was available \nthrough some of the affected HR account credentials, and potential access to or acquisition of \nthose files before the accounts were locked down could not be definitively ruled out. \n\nInformation  that  may  have  been  available  through  the  impacted  employee  credentials  include \nnames, contact information, social security numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, bank \nrouting numbers, dates of employment, salary information, benefits election and insurance policy \n\nSidley Austin (DC) LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership doing business as Sidley Austin LLP and practicing in affiliation with other Sidley Austin partnerships. \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\n \ninformation,  and  other  related \ncorrespondence related to insurance eligibility and claims escalations.  \n\ninformation  maintained  for  HR  purposes,  as  well  as \n\nGannett estimates that approximately 18,100 individuals were affected by this incident and will \nbe providing notice, including to approximately 634 Iowa residents, beginning April 28, 2017.  \nAs a precautionary measure, Gannett is also providing one year of credit monitoring and identity \ntheft protection services to potentially affected individuals through AllClear ID, as described in \nthe attached sample notice letter.   \n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  \n\n \n\n \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\n \n \nColleen Theresa Brown  \nPartner \nSidley Austin LLP \n(202) 736-8465 \n\n2 \n\n\x0c(cid:128)(cid:9)(cid:101)(cid:34)(cid:93)(cid:36)(cid:84)(cid:26)(cid:103)(cid:28)(cid:114)(cid:53)(cid:94)(cid:13)(cid:107)(cid:43)\n(cid:128)(cid:37)(cid:28)(cid:68)(cid:7)(cid:17)(cid:106)(cid:111)(cid:24)(cid:89)(cid:110)(cid:89)(cid:58)(cid:4)(cid:103)(cid:86)\n(cid:97)(cid:97)(cid:33)(cid:33)(cid:33)(cid:33)(cid:33)(cid:33)(cid:97)(cid:33)(cid:97)(cid:33)(cid:97)(cid:33)(cid:97)(cid:33)\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nACD1234\n\n00001\nJOHN Q.

We take theprotection of your information very seriously and are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances, steps we aretaking in response, and resources we are making available to you.What Happened?On Thursday, March 30, 2017, we discovered that several members of our HR department were victims of a phishingattack that compromised their Office 365 account login credentials, including their Gannett email.

This attempt was identified by our finance team assuspicious and was unsuccessful.Upon discovering this incident, we took immediate action to lock down the impacted accounts and alert other Gannettemployees about the phishing email to prevent others from being victimized by the phishing scheme as well.  We alsobegan an investigation to understand the scope of the incident, confirmed that other Gannett systems were unaffected,and contacted federal law enforcement.At this time, there is no indication that there was any acquisition of any sensitive personal data.  Nevertheless, we areproviding this notice out of an abundance of caution because your information was available through some of the affectedHR account login credentials, and potential access to or acquisition of that information, before the accounts were lockeddown, could not be definitively ruled out.What Information Was Involved?Information that may have been available through the impacted employee credentials includes names, contactinformation, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, bank routing numbers, dates of employment,salary information, benefits election and insurance policy information, and other related information maintained for HRpurposes.What We Are Doing.Upon discovery of the phishing attack, the Gannett cybersecurity team immediately sent out an alert to warn otherpotential recipients of the phishing email, and to identify all employees who may have been impacted.

We also conducted a forensic investigation to confirm that no other company systems were impacted, and thatno company or personal data had been emailed out of the impacted accounts.

Walnut Street \nDes Moines, Iowa 50319-0106 \n \nDear Sir or Madam, \n \n\nI represent TALX Corporation (\xe2\x80\x9cTALX\xe2\x80\x9d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Equifax Inc., \n\nand write regarding a data security incident that may have exposed personal information of some \nIowa residents, who are employees or former employees of Allegis Group Inc. and its \nsubsidiaries (\xe2\x80\x9cAllegis\xe2\x80\x9d). In a limited number of instances, the residents may be family members \nof employees or former employees of Allegis.  \n \n\nTALX provides payroll-related services for Allegis and other companies, which in the \ncase of Allegis, current and former employees are able to access through TALX\xe2\x80\x99s online portal \navailable at www.mytaxform.com or https://PaperlessPay.TALX.com/allegis. On February 1, \n2017, TALX learned that an Allegis employee had reported an unauthorized change to the email \naddress associated with the employee\xe2\x80\x99s online portal account. Upon learning of the potential \nunauthorized access, TALX and Allegis worked together promptly to understand what happened. \nOn February 22, 2017, TALX, working with Allegis, concluded that 44 Allegis employees\xe2\x80\x99 \naccounts might have been accessed without authorization. Those employees were notified by \nmail on March 3, 2017, although none of them reside in Iowa.1 TALX also engaged a leading \ncybersecurity firm to assist with its analysis.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n1 After the notifications were mailed, TALX and Allegis continued to investigate and confirmed \nthat the access attempts into the TALX online portal accounts for six of the 44 individuals\xe2\x80\x99 accounts were \nfailed unauthorized attempts.  \n\n \n\n\x0cConsumer Protection Division \nOffice of the Attorney General of Iowa \nMay 15, 2017 \n \n\nFollowing the initial round of employee notifications, TALX, again working with \n\nAllegis, continued to analyze accesses to Allegis employee online portal accounts. On April 24, \n2017, TALX identified a broad universe of current and former employees (and in some instances \nfamily members) whose information might have been accessed without authorization between \nJanuary 4, 2016 and March 29, 2017. Based on the analysis to date, TALX believes that the \nunauthorized third-party(ies) gained access to the accounts primarily by successfully answering \npersonal questions about the affected employees in order to reset the employees\xe2\x80\x99 PINs (i.e., the \npassword to access the online portal). There is no indication that either TALX or Allegis was the \nsource of any of the information used to reset the PINs and access the accounts. Because the \naccesses generally appear legitimate (e.g., successful use of login credentials), TALX cannot \nconfirm forensically exactly which accounts were, in fact, accessed without authorization, \nalthough TALX believes that only a small percentage of these potentially affected accounts were \nactually affected. While we are continuing to investigate the incident, out of an abundance of \ncaution, TALX and Allegis are notifying the broad universe of current and former Allegis \nemployees identified as potentially affected during the investigation, as well as the covered \nindividuals (i.e., family members) whose information may have been accessed through a current \nor former employee\xe2\x80\x99s 1095-C form.  \n\n \nAccess to the employees\xe2\x80\x99 online accounts would have permitted the unauthorized third-\n\nparty(ies) access to the employees\xe2\x80\x99 W-2 forms and, in a limited number of instances, 1095-C \nforms, which, for some employees, include personal information relating to family members \ncovered by Allegis\xe2\x80\x99s health insurance. The unauthorized third-party(ies) would have also been \nable to access other information maintained in the employees\xe2\x80\x99 respective online portal accounts, \nincluding the employee\xe2\x80\x99s name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, wage and direct \ndeposit information, employee identification number, email address, gender, and marital status. \n \n\nTALX has also notified federal law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and \n\nstate tax authorities of the incident. Additionally, to help prevent recurrence of this type of \nincident, TALX has implemented additional security measures, including enhanced fraud \nmonitoring. TALX also removed the personal questions as an option to reset PINs from the \nonline portal and worked with Allegis to reset potentially affected employees\xe2\x80\x99 PINs, removed \nunverified contact information (email addresses and phone numbers) associated with employees\xe2\x80\x99 \naccounts, and added valid contact information from Allegis, where available, for the purpose of \nutilizing one-time passcodes as part of multi-factor authentication. \n\n \nOn May 11, 2017, TALX, working with Allegis, notified by mail the 613 Iowa residents \nwho may have been affected by the incident and fit within the broad universe. TALX provided \nthose notices as soon as reasonably practicable. Unaddressed copies of the notifications (which \nvary depending on the type of personal information affected) are attached to this letter. \nAdditionally, the affected individuals are being offered two (2) years of AllClearID identity \nprotection service at no cost to the individuals. This service will provide the individuals with \ncredit monitoring, a $1 million identity theft insurance policy, and the dedicated assistance of \ninvestigators to help recover financial losses, restore credit, and return their identity to its proper \ncondition in the event a problem arises. \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cConsumer Protection Division \nOffice of the Attorney General of Iowa \nMay 15, 2017 \n \n\n \n \nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. \n\nSincerely, \n\n \n\nNicholas A.

You may also contact the FTC to obtain \nadditional information about avoiding identity theft. \n\nFederal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center\n600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338)\nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft\nState  Attorneys  General:  Information  on  how  to  contact  your  state  attorney  general  may  be  found  at  \nwww.naag.org/naag/attorneys-general/whos-my-ag.php.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider \nplacing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in \nyour name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you.  It also may delay your ability to \nobtain credit.  You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer reporting \nagencies.  Contact information for each of the three credit reporting agencies is as follows:.\n\nEquifax\n\nExperian\n\nEquifax Credit Information Services, Inc.\nP.O. Box 740241\nAtlanta, GA 30374\nExperian Inc.\nP.O. Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013\nTransUnion TransUnion LLC\n\nP.O.

You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays \nin your file for at least 90 days.  An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven \nyears. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof \nof your identity, which may include your Social Security number.  If you ask for an extended alert, you will \nhave to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with \na federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may \nrequire you to submit. For more detailed information about the identity theft report, visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft/.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d (also \nknown  as  a  \xe2\x80\x9ccredit  freeze\xe2\x80\x9d)  on  your  credit  file.  A  security  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  creditors \nfrom accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. There may be fees for \nplacing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a fraud \nalert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For \nmore information on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the \nFTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please \ncontact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.\nThe consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request. For example, \nyou may be asked to provide:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your Social Security number\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your date of birth\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Addresses where you have lived over the past five years\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (e.g., a state driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or military  \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account statement)\n\nID card)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  For Maryland Residents.

If you ask for an extended alert, you will \nhave to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with \na federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may \nrequire you to submit. For more detailed information about the identity theft report, visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft/. \n\xe2\x80\xa2  Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d (also \nknown  as  a  \xe2\x80\x9ccredit  freeze\xe2\x80\x9d)  on  your  credit  file.  A  security  freeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  creditors \nfrom accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. There may be fees for \nplacing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a fraud \nalert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For \nmore information on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the \nFTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please \ncontact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.\nThe consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request. For example, \nyou may be asked to provide:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your Social Security number\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Your date of birth\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Addresses where you have lived over the past five years\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A  legible  copy  of  a  government-issued  identification  card  (e.g.,  a  state  driver\xe2\x80\x99s  license  or  military  \n\nID card)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account statement)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  For Maryland Residents.

To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider \nplacing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in \nyour name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to \nobtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer reporting \nagencies. Contact information for each of the three credit reporting agencies is as follows:\n\nR6343 v.04 05.09.2017\n\n\x0cEquifax\n\nExperian\n\nEquifax Credit Information Services, Inc.\nP.O.

You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays \nin your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven \nyears. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of \nyour identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended alert, you will have to \nprovide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a federal, \nstate, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may require you \nto submit. For more detailed information about the identity theft report, visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft/. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File.

A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in \nyour name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you.  It also may delay your ability to \nobtain credit.  You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer reporting \nagencies.

An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven \nyears. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof \nof your identity, which may include your Social Security number.  If you ask for an extended alert, you will \nhave to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with \na federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may \nrequire you to submit.

On April 5, 2017, Chipotle identified a suspicious \nprocess  running  on  the  point  of  sale  devices  at  certain  Chipotle  Mexican  Grill  restaurants.  \nChipotle immediately started an investigation with the assistance of leading computer security \nfirms to determine the nature and scope of the issue.  On April 25, 2017, Chipotle added a page \nto its website notifying its customers of the investigation. By May 23, 2017, findings from the \ninvestigation  were  available  to  accurately  identify  the  restaurants  and  specific  time  frames \ninvolved in this incident.\n\nFindings from  the  completed investigation show  the  operation of  malware designed to \naccess  payment  card  data  from  cards  used  on  point-of-sale  (POS)  devices  at  certain  Chipotle \nMexican  Grill  and  restaurants  between  March  24,  2017  and  April  18,  2017.    The  malware \nspecifically searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card \nnumber,  expiration  date,  and  internal  verification  code)  read  from  the  magnetic  stripe  of  a \npayment card as it was being routed through the POS device. There is no indication that other \ncustomer  information  was  affected,  and  the  incident  did  not  involve  payment  cards  used  on \nChipotle\xe2\x80\x99s websites.\n\nChipotle  does  not  collect  the  mailing  or  email  address  from  customers  when  they  use \ntheir  payment  cards.    Thus,  Chipotle  is  not  able  to  identify  the  name  and  mailing  address  of \nindividuals who used their card during the time period of this incident.  Chipotle, therefore, is \n\n\x0cOffice of the Attorney General of Iowa\nMay 26, 2017\nPage 2\n\nunable to identify the number of Iowa residents that used a card during the time frame of this \nincident.    Instead,  on  May  26,  2017,  pursuant  to  Ia.  Code  Ann.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7  715C.1  et  seq.,  Chipotle \nprovided  substitute  notification  to  Iowa  residents  who  may  have  used  their  payment  cards  at \naffected Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants during the time period of this incident by posting a \nstatement  on  its  websites  and  issuing  a  press  release  (copies  enclosed).    Notification  is  being \nprovided in the most expeditious manner possible and without unreasonable delay after measures \nwere taken to eradicate the malware and findings became available to determine the apparently \naffected restaurants and specific time frames.  See Ia. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 715C.1 et seq.\n\nChipotle has removed the malware and continues to work with cyber security firms to \nevaluate  ways  to  enhance  its  security  measures.  In  addition,  Chipotle  has  notified  law \nenforcement about the incident and is also working closely with the payment card companies to \nidentify  potentially  affected  cards.  Lastly,  Chipotle  established  a  dedicated  call  center  that \ncustomers can call with related questions. \n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCraig A.

(Chipotle) is providing further information about the payment card\nsecurity incident that Chipotle previously reported on April 25, 2017. The information comes at the\ncompletion of an investigation that involved leading cyber security firms, law enforcement, and the\npayment card networks.\n\nThe investigation identified the operation of malware designed to access payment card data from\ncards used on point-of-sale (POS) devices at certain Chipotle restaurants between March 24, 2017\nand April 18, 2017. The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in\naddition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe\nof a payment card as it was being routed through the POS device. There is no indication that other\ncustomer information was affected. A list of affected Chipotle restaurant locations and specific time\nframes is available here. Not all locations were involved, and the specific time frames vary by\nlocation.\n\nIt is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card\nstatements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to\nyour card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible\nfor unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.  The phone number to call is usually on the\nback of your payment card.  Please see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you\nmay take.\n\nDuring the investigation we removed the malware, and we continue to work with cyber security firms\nto evaluate ways to enhance our security measures. In addition, we continue to support law\nenforcement\xe2\x80\x99s investigation and are working with the payment card networks so that the banks that\nissue payment cards can be made aware and initiate heightened monitoring.\n\nIf customers have questions regarding this incident, you can call 888-738-0534  Monday through\nFriday between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. EDT, or Saturday and Sunday between the\nhours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EDT.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ON WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF\n\nhttps://www-chipotle-com.test-live.cms.chipotle.com/security[5/26/2017 9:26:39 AM]\n\n\x0cChipotle \xe2\x80\x94 Security Incident\n\nWe remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing\nyour account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

You can obtain information from these sources about steps\nan individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security\nfreezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report.\nObtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your\nrecords. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:\n\nFederal Trade Commission \nConsumer Response Center \n600 Pennsylvania Avenue \nNW Washington, DC 20580\n1-877-IDTHEFT  (438-4338)\nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft\n\nFraud Alerts: To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your\ncredit file. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it\ntells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to obtain\ncredit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer\nreporting agencies:\n\nEquifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111\nExperian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742\n\nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289\n\nAs soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must\nplace fraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial\nSecurity Alert) stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert)\nstays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will\nrequire you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security\n\nhttps://www-chipotle-com.test-live.cms.chipotle.com/security[5/26/2017 9:26:39 AM]\n\n\x0cChipotle \xe2\x80\x94 Security Incident\n\nnumber. If you ask for an extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity\ntheft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement\nagency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For\nmore detailed information about the identity theft report, visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft/.\n\nSecurity Freeze: You may wish to place a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity freeze\xe2\x80\x9d (also known as a \xe2\x80\x9ccredit freeze\xe2\x80\x9d) on your\ncredit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file\nat the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting,\nand/or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a fraud\nalert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency\nindividually. In order to request a security freeze, the consumer reporting agencies may require\nproper identification prior to honoring your request and ask that you provide:\n\n1.  Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)\n2.  Social Security number\n3.  Date of birth\n4.  If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over\n\nthe prior five years\n\n5.  Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill\n6.  A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver\'s license or ID\n\ncard, military identification, etc.)\n\n7.  If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or\n\ncomplaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft\n\nAs the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the\nthree consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.\n\nIf you are a resident of Maryland, you may contact the Maryland Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office at 200\nSt. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, www.oag.state.md.us, 1-888-743-0023 .\n\nIf you are a resident of North Carolina, you may contact the North Carolina Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s\nOffice at 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, www.ncdoj.gov, 1-919-716- 6400.\n\nIf you are a resident of Massachusetts, note that you have the right to obtain a police report and\nrequest a security freeze as described above.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause.\n\nWhat Happened\nAfter  receiving  a  report  that  data  from  payment  cards  used  on  www.GameStop.com  may  have  been  obtained  by\nunauthorized  individuals,  we  immediately  began  an  investigation  and  hired  a  leading  cybersecurity  firm  to  assist  us.\nAlthough the investigation did not identify evidence of unauthorized access to payment card data, we determined on April\n18,  2017  that  the  potential  for  that  to  have  occurred  existed  for  certain  transactions.    Findings  from  the  investigation\nsuggest that, for customers who placed or attempted to place orders on our website from August 10, 2016 to February 9,\n2017, information associated with the order being placed, including the customer\xc2\x92s name, address, payment card number,\nexpiration  date  and  security  code  (CVV),  may  have  been  obtained  by  an  unauthorized  third-party.

To  help  prevent  this  type  of  incident  from\nhappening again, we are continuing to take steps to strengthen the security of our network.  \n\nWhat You Can Do\nWe encourage that you remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your financial statements\nand credit reports for any unauthorized activity.  You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your financial\ninstitution, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges\nthat  are  timely  reported.

You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit\nreport if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report\nfor  at  least  90  days.  You  may  have  an  extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity\ntheft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place\na fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free\nnumbers listed at the bottom of this page.\n\nCredit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new\ncredit  can  be  opened  in  your  name  without  the  use  of  a  PIN  number  that  is  issued  to  you  when  you  initiate  a  freeze.  A  credit\nfreeze  is  designed  to  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from  accessing  your  credit  report  without  your  consent.  If  you  place  a\ncredit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily\nlift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift\nand/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a\ncredit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must\nseparately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a\ncredit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out\nmore information.\n\nYou  can  obtain  more  information  about  fraud  alerts  and  credit  freezes  by  contacting  the  FTC  or  one  of  the  national  credit\nreporting agencies listed below.\n\n0123456\n\nNational Credit Reporting Agencies\n\nEquifax (www.equifax.com)\nP.O.

An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.\nYou  may  have  an  extended  alert  placed  on  your  credit  report  if  you  have  already  been  a victim of identity theft with the appropriate\ndocumentary  proof.    An  extended  fraud  alert  stays  on  your  credit  report  for  seven  years.    You  can  place  a  fraud  alert  on  your  credit\nreport by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this\npage.\n\nCredit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit\ncan be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.  A credit freeze is designed\nto  prevent  potential  credit  grantors  from  accessing  your  credit  report  without  your  consent.    If  you  place  a  credit  freeze,  potential\ncreditors  and  other  third  parties  will  not  be  able  to  get  access  to  your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore,\nusing a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze.\nCredit  freeze  laws  vary  from  state  to  state.    The  cost  of  placing,  temporarily  lifting,  and  removing  a  credit  freeze  also  varies  by  state,\ngenerally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your\ncredit file at each credit reporting company.  Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please\ncontact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.\n\nYou  can  obtain  more  information  about  fraud  alerts  and  credit  freezes  by  contacting  the  FTC  or  one  of  the  national  credit  reporting\nagencies listed below.\n\nNational Credit Reporting Agencies Contact Information\n\nEquifax (www.equifax.com)\n\nExperian (www.experian.com)\n\nTransUnion (www.transunion.com)\n\nGeneral Contact:\nP.O.

A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.  For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit.  The contact information for all three credit bureaus is below:  Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.  Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report.  A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent.  To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency.  You may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below.  The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.  The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.  The consumer reporting agency may charge a small fee to place, life, or remove a freeze, but is free if you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the consumer reporting agency.  You may obtain a security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:  Equifax Security Freeze P.O.

(\xe2\x80\x9cJason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCompany\xe2\x80\x9d). \nJason\xe2\x80\x99s  Deli  is  a  family-owned  restaurant  business  known  for  high-quality  food  and \ncatering services for over 40 years. It is headquartered in Beaumont, Texas and operates or \nfranchises 266 restaurants in 28 states, including one location in Iowa. \n \n \nOn December 22, 2017, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli was notified by payment processors that credit \ncard security personnel had informed it that a large quantity of payment card information \nhad appeared for sale on the \xe2\x80\x9cdark web,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an analysis of the data indicated that at \nleast a portion of the data may have come from various Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli locations. Jason\xe2\x80\x99s \nDeli\xe2\x80\x99s management immediately activated its response plan, including engagement of a \nleading threat response team, involvement of other forensic experts, and cooperation with \nlaw enforcement. The Company released a preliminary public statement on December 28, \n2017 describing the situation and its initial response. \n \n \nFrom our initial investigation findings, criminals deployed RAM-scraping malware \non a number of our point-of-sales (POS) terminals at various corporate-owned Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli \nrestaurants  (see  Appendix  A  attached  for  list  of  potentially  affected  restaurant \nlocations) starting on June 8, 2017. During the course of the investigation, the Company\xe2\x80\x99s \nresponse team contained the security breach and has also disabled the malware in all of the \nlocations where it was discovered. \n \n \nBased on the facts known to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli at this time, the Company believes that \nthe  criminals  used  the  malware  to  obtain  payment  card  information  off  of  the  POS \nterminals beginning on June 8, 2017. Our investigation has determined that approximately \n2 million unique payment card numbers may have been impacted in total. While we do not \nbelieve the Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurant located in your state is affected, residents of Iowa may \nhave been impacted if they visited a Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli out of state.  \n\nLaw Offices \n\n1500 K Street, NW \nSuite 1100 \nWashington, DC \n20005-1209 \n\n202-842-8800 \n202-842-8465 fax \nwww.drinkerbiddle.com \n\nCALIFORNIA \n\nDELAWARE \n\nILLINOIS \n\nNEW JERSEY \n\nNEW YORK \n\nPENNSYLVANIA \n\nTEXAS \n\nWASHINGTON D.C. \n\n   \n\n \n\nEstablished 1849 \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nNotice of a Security Breach \nJanuary 11, 2018 \nPage 2 \n\n  \n \nSpecifically,  the  payment  card  information  obtained  was  full  track  data  from  a \npayment card\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic stripe. While this information varies from card issuer to card \nissuer,  full  track  data  can  include  the  following:  cardholder  name,  credit  or  debit  card \nnumber,  expiration  date,  cardholder  verification  value,  and  service  code.  However,  it \nshould be noted that the cardholder verification value that may have been compromised is \nnot the same as the three-digit value printed on the back of certain payment cards (e.g., \nDiscover,  MasterCard,  and  Visa)  or  the  four-digit  value  printed  on  the  front  of  other \npayment  cards  (e.g.,  American  Express).  In  addition,  the  track  data  does  not  include \npersonal identification numbers (PINs) associated with debit cards. \n \n \nPlease  be  assured  that  Jason\xe2\x80\x99s  Deli  is  taking  this  matter  very  seriously.  The \nCompany  has  worked  diligently  with  third-party  forensics  and  cyber  security  firms  to \ninvestigate and contain the breach. The Company is in regular communications with the \ncredit card companies and has provided them with the information necessary to notify the \nbanks  that  may  have  issued  the  affected  credit  and  debit  cards.  We  also  immediately \nnotified federal law enforcement officials upon  discovering the breach  and continue to \ncooperate with their investigation. \n \n \nJason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli plans to post the attached consumer notification letter online through \nits  website  and  social  media  (see  Appendix  B  attached  for  a  copy  of  the  consumer \nnotice) on January 12, 2018, which will include instructions to obtain information about \nthe breach and options available to them, including a dedicated customer service email \ncustomer.service@jasonsdeli.com,  and  phone  line,  409-838-1976,  Monday  through \nFriday,  8am  to  5pm  CST.

payment processors that credit card \nsecurity personnel had informed it that a large quantity of payment card information had appeared \nfor sale on the \xe2\x80\x9cdark web,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an analysis of the data indicated that at least a portion of the \ndata may have come from various Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli locations. Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli\xe2\x80\x99s management immediately \nactivated our response plan, including engagement of a leading threat response team, involvement \nof other forensic experts, and cooperation with law enforcement. We released a preliminary public \nstatement on December 28, 2017 describing the situation and our initial response. \n \nFrom our initial investigation findings, criminals deployed RAM-scraping malware on a \nnumber of our point-of-sales (POS) terminals at various corporate-owned Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurants \n(see Appendix A for a list) starting on June 8, 2017. During the course of the investigation, our \nresponse  team  contained  the  security  breach  and  has  also  disabled  the  malware  in  all  of  the \nlocations where it was discovered. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved? \n \nBased on the facts known to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli at this time, we believe that the criminals used \nthe malware to obtain payment card information off of the POS terminals beginning on June 8, \n2017.  Our  investigation  has  determined  that  approximately  2  million  unique  payment  card \nnumbers may have been impacted. Specifically, the payment card information obtained was full \ntrack data from a payment card\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic stripe. While this information varies from card issuer \nto card issuer, full track data can include the following: cardholder name, credit or debit card \nnumber, expiration date, cardholder verification value, and service code. However, it should be \nnoted that the cardholder verification value that may have been compromised is not the same as \nthe three-digit value printed on the back of certain payment cards (e.g., Discover, MasterCard, and \nVisa) or the four-digit value printed on the front of other payment cards (e.g., American Express). \nIn addition, the track data does not include personal identification numbers (\xe2\x80\x9cPINs\xe2\x80\x9d) associated \nwith debit cards. \n \nWhat Are We Doing? \n \nSince the breach was discovered, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli has worked closely with third-party forensics \nand cyber security firms, as well as federal law enforcement, to investigate and contain the breach.  \n \nWhat Can You Do? \n\n\x0cDeli Management, Inc. \nNotice of a Data Breach \n \n \nTo determine whether you may have been affected by this security breach, we recommend \nthat you review the list of potentially affected Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurants (see Appendix A for a list) \nand review your credit and debit card statements for any unauthorized charges.

A  fraud alert can  make it more difficult for someone to  get credit in  your name \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your \nability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three \nnationwide consumer reporting agencies. Contact information for each of the three credit \nreporting agencies is provided above. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then \nalso must place fraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. \nAn initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended \nalert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven years. To place either of \nthese alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of \nyour identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended \nalert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a \ncopy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and \nadditional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more \ndetailed information about the identity theft report, visit http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  You may also obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and \nensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to \nplace a security freeze on your credit report pursuant to West Virginia law. The security \n\n\x0cDeli Management, Inc. \nNotice of a Data Breach \n \n\nfreeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your \ncredit report without your express authorization or approval. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved \nin your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, \nwithin five business days you will be provided a unique PIN or password to use if you \nchoose  to  remove  the  freeze  on  your  credit  report  or  to  temporarily  authorize  the \ndistribution of your credit report for a period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide \nthat authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the \nfollowing: \n\n1.  The unique PIN or password provided by the consumer reporting agency; \n2.  Proper identification to verify your identity; and \n3.  The period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit \n\nreport. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a \nfreeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days \nafter receiving the request. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account \nrelationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents \nor  affiliates  for  certain  types  of  account  review,  collection,  fraud  control  or  similar \nactivities. \nIf you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in \nlifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. We advise that you plan \nahead and lift a freeze, either completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a \ncertain creditor, several days before actually applying for new credit. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\n \nFor More Information: \nPlease contact Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli at 350 Pine Street, Suite 1775, Beaumont, TX 77701, email \n \ncustomer.service@jasonsdeli.com, or call 409-838-1976, Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm \nCST. \n\n\x0c'",01-11-18,Iowa

(NYSE: EFX) today announced that the company has confirmed the identities of \nU.S. consumers whose partial driver\xe2\x80\x99s license information was taken. Equifax was able to identify these \nconsumers by referencing other information in proprietary company records that the attackers did not \nsteal, and by engaging the resources of an external data provider. \n \nThrough these additional efforts, Equifax was able to identify approximately 2.4 million U.S. consumers \nwhose names and partial driver\xe2\x80\x99s license information were stolen, but who were not in the previously \nidentified affected population discussed in the company\xe2\x80\x99s prior disclosures about the incident. This \ninformation was partial because, in the vast majority of cases, it did not include consumers\xe2\x80\x99 home \naddresses, or their respective driver\xe2\x80\x99s license states, dates of issuance, or expiration dates. \n \nThe methodology used in the company\xe2\x80\x99s forensic examination of last year\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity incident \nleveraged Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and names as the key data elements to identify who was \naffected by the cyberattack.  This was in part because forensics experts had determined that the \nattackers were predominately focused on stealing SSNs. Today\xe2\x80\x99s newly identified consumers were not \npreviously informed because their SSNs were not stolen together with their partial driver\xe2\x80\x99s license \ninformation.   \n \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not about newly discovered stolen data,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paulino do Rego Barros, Jr., Interim Chief \nExecutive Officer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about sifting through the previously identified stolen data, analyzing other \ninformation in our databases that was not taken by the attackers, and making connections that enabled \nus to identify additional individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \nEquifax will notify these newly identified U.S. consumers directly, and will offer identity theft protection \nand credit file monitoring services at no cost to them. Information about registering for these services \nwill be included in the notification. \n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe continue to take broad measures to identify, inform, and protect consumers who may have been \naffected by this cyberattack,\xe2\x80\x9d Barros added. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are committed to regaining the trust of consumers, \nimproving transparency, and enhancing security across our network.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n \nAs the company committed to do, Equifax launched Lock & Alert\xe2\x84\xa2 to all U.S. consumers on January \n31. This new service, which is free for life, enables consumers to quickly lock and unlock their Equifax \ncredit report using a computer or app downloaded on their mobile device.  \n \nImportantly, the company\xe2\x80\x99s forensics experts have found no evidence that Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s core consumer, \nemployment and income, or commercial credit reporting databases were accessed as part of the \ncyberattack, and the company believes it will have met all applicable requirements to notify consumers.   \n \nSince announcing this incident, Equifax has taken steps to communicate with and assist consumers \nand customers. Among other things, the company has established a web portal advising U.S. \nconsumers to review their account statements and credit reports, identify any unauthorized activity, and \nprotect their personal information from further attack. Additionally, the company offered free identity \n\n\t\n\n\x0ctheft protection and credit file monitoring services to all U.S. consumers regardless of whether or not \nthey were impacted.  \n \nConsumers can visit www.equifaxsecurity2017.com for more information about the cybersecurity \nincident and for answers to frequently asked questions. \n \nForward-Looking Statements \n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information.

Walnut Street \nDes Moines, IA 50319-0106 \nconsumer@ag.iowa.gov  \n \nRe: Legal Notice of Information Security Breach Pursuant to Iowa Code \xc2\xa7 715C.2 \n \nTo Whom It May Concern:  \n \nIn accordance with the above-referenced provision of Iowa law, I write to inform you of a data \nsecurity incident affecting residents of Iowa.  \n \nWhile conducting an investigation of a legacy Orbitz travel booking platform (the \xe2\x80\x9cplatform\xe2\x80\x9d), we \ndetermined on March 1, 2018 that there was evidence that, between October 1, 2017 and December \n22, 2017, an attacker may have accessed personal information, stored on the platform, that was \nsubmitted for certain purchases made between January 1, 2016 and June 22, 2016.  The platform \nis provided directly to consumers (\xe2\x80\x9cdirect consumers\xe2\x80\x9d) as well as to business partner customers.  \nWe took immediate steps to investigate the incident and enhance security and monitoring of the \naffected platform, and made every effort to remediate the issue, including taking swift action to \neliminate and prevent unauthorized access to the platform. \n \nOn March 1, 2018, we determined that the personal information that was likely accessed may have \nincluded  full  name,  payment  card  information,  date  of  birth,  phone  number,  email  address, \nphysical and/or billing address, and gender.  Our investigation to date has not found any evidence \nof  unauthorized  access  to  other  types  of  personal  information,  including  passport  and  travel \nitinerary information.  Additionally, Social Security numbers were not involved in this incident, \nas these are not collected through nor held on the platform.    \n \nUpon learning of the incident, Orbitz took immediate steps to protect consumers by investigating \nthe  incident  and  enhancing  security  and  monitoring  of  the  affected  platform.    As  part  of  our \ninvestigation and remediation work, we brought in a leading third party forensic investigation firm \nand  other  cybersecurity  experts,  began  working  with  law  enforcement,  and  took  measures  to \neffectively prevent any  unauthorized access and enhance security.   Upon determining that the \nattack  may  have  resulted  in  access  to  certain  personal  information,  we  also  started  working \nimmediately  to  notify  potentially  impacted  direct  consumers  and  business  partners  whose \ncustomers used the platform.   \n \nWe plan to notify approximately 1,546 potentially affected direct consumers who are residents of \nIowa.    Enclosed  is  a  copy  of  the  notification  letter  that  will  be  sent  to  affected  U.S.  direct \nconsumers  via  first-class  mail  between  March  22  and  23,  2018.    For  certain  affected  direct \nconsumers for whom we have an email address and not a payment billing address, this notification \nwill be provided via email.  We have also issued a media advisory explaining the incident to the \n\n  \n\n\x0cgeneral public and established a public website (orbitz.allclearid.com) to provide additional details \nfound in the notification letters.  We plan to provide notices of this incident to the three major \ncredit reporting agencies on March 21, 2018. \n \nThe notification to individuals includes (1) a description of the incident and the type of personal \ninformation at issue; (2) the actions taken by Orbitz to protect personal information from further \nunauthorized  access;  (3)  Orbitz\xe2\x80\x99s  address  and  a  toll-free  phone  number  to  call  for  further \ninformation  and  assistance;  (4)  information  on  how  the  individual  may  enroll  in  free  credit \nmonitoring and other complimentary services arranged by Orbitz; (5) information about how to \nplace a fraud alert or security freeze on a credit report; (6) the toll-free numbers and addresses for \nthe  major  consumer  reporting  agencies;  (7)  the  toll-free  number,  address,  and  website  for  the \nFederal Trade Commission, and a statement that individuals can obtain information on identity \ntheft from this source; and (8) advice that directs the individual to remain vigilant by reviewing \naccount statements and monitoring free credit reports. \n  \nIn addition to notifying direct consumers, we have notified affected business partners and will \nmake  available  the  following  information  and  services  to  each  partner  whose  customers\xe2\x80\x99 \ninformation may have been affected by this incident:  a full list of impacted customers; consumer \nnotice  support  by  AllClear  ID,  which  includes  logistical  support  for  printed  notifications,  a \ncustomer notification template, and a centralized call center to which partners can direct their \ncustomers who may have questions; talking points and frequently asked questions to assist partners \nin  their  own  discussions  with  their  customers;  and  one  year  of  credit  monitoring  and  identity \nprotection  service  in  countries  where  the  service  is  available  for  affected  customers  from  our \nproviders AllClear ID and Experian.  These partners may choose to notify regulators and affected \nindividuals independently.   \n \nIf you have any questions or need further information regarding this incident, please contact Cathy \nBump at cathybump@orbitz.com. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nCathy Bump \nGlobal Privacy Director \n500 W.

TJIA immediately \nbegan investigating the incident and obtained the services of a computer security firm to assist \nwith the investigation.  As a result of the investigation, TJIA has determined that the server in \nquestion was compromised as the result of a phishing attack on or about July 14, 2017.  The \ncompromised server contained personal information about current and former employees, \nincluding name, address, telephone number, date of birth, compensation information, social \nsecurity number and, if direct deposit was used by the employee, bank account number and bank \nrouting number.  \n\nIn response, TJIA has taken steps to eradicate the unauthorized access to the server and to restore \nthe integrity of its systems, including taking off line, decommissioning, and/or replacing any \naffected computers or servers, as well as reconfiguring and enhancing certain firewall \ncapabilities.  TJIA has also communicated with the FBI about the incident and will continue to \ncooperate with the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s investigation into the incident.

This letter provides you with more information \nabout what happened and informs you of additional steps we are taking to protect your personal information. We truly value your \nbusiness and understand the value you place on the protection of your information. \n\nWhat Happened? \n\nOn April 12, 2018, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to our systems.

You may contact the FTC or your state\'s \nregulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding and protection against identity theft: Federal Trade \nCommission, Consumer Response Center 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft.  \n\nResidents of Maryland, North Carolina and Rhode Island may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft by \ncontacting: Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-\n743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us; North Carolina Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division, 9001 Mail Service \nCenter, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-919-716-6400, www.ncdoj.gov; and Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General, Consumer \nProtection Unit, 150 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02903, 1-401-274-4400, www.riag.ri.gov. \n \nFraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be \na victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you \nsuspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 \ndays. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the \nappropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on \nyour credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the toll-free numbers listed below: \n \nEquifax \n877-478-7625 \n \nCredit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new \ncredit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze \nis designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, \npotential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. \nTherefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a \ncredit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also \nvaries by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a \ncredit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ \nfrom state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information. \n\nExperian \n888-397-3742 \n\nTransUnion \n800-680-7289 \n\n \n\n\x0cTaskRabbit,\xc2\xa0Inc.\nReturn\xc2\xa0Mail\xc2\xa0Processing\nPO\xc2\xa0Box\xc2\xa0374\nClaysburg,\xc2\xa0PA\xc2\xa016625\xe2\x80\x900374\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH \nPlease read this entire letter. \n  \nDear\xc2\xa0SAMPLE\xc2\xa0A\xc2\xa0SAMPLE:\n \n\n ALGPBPEPDMHPBNAOHK \n AMJKHEPDNPJJGBOMLK \n AKDBMHPONJGAKGHFIK \n AKBMDJDOINACNJDKOK \n DLDLLLDLDDLLLLDDLL \n\nD7442\xe2\x80\x90L02\xe2\x80\x900123456\xc2\xa00001\xc2\xa000000001\xc2\xa0***********MIXED\xc2\xa0AADC\xc2\xa0159\nSAMPLE\xc2\xa0A\xc2\xa0SAMPLE\n123\xc2\xa0ANY\xc2\xa0ST\nANYTOWN,\xc2\xa0US\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa012345\xe2\x80\x906789\nrppssrsrsrprprspsppsqsrppqqprsqprpqrssrsppppspsrqqssqqsprqqqrrrrs\n\nMay\xc2\xa010,\xc2\xa02018\n\nThis letter is a follow-up to the email communications we sent to the TaskRabbit community, alerting users regarding a recent \ncybersecurity incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

No. 2018-199838 \n \nDear Director Whitney: \n \n \nWe are writing to update you on an institutional data breach. Per our letter dated \nJanuary 11, 2018. Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP represents Deli Management, Inc., doing \nbusiness as Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli, Inc. (\xe2\x80\x9cJason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCompany\xe2\x80\x9d). Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli is a family-\nowned  restaurant  business,  headquartered  in  Beaumont,  Texas,  which  operates  or \nfranchises 266 restaurants in 28 states, including one location in Iowa. \n \n \nAs  we previously reported, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli  was notified  by  payment  processors on \nDecember 22, 2017 that credit card security personnel had informed it that a large quantity \nof payment card information had appeared for sale on the \xe2\x80\x9cdark web,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an analysis \nof the data indicated that at least a portion of the data may have come from various Jason\xe2\x80\x99s \nDeli  locations.  Jason\xe2\x80\x99s  Deli\xe2\x80\x99s  management  immediately  activated  our  response  plan, \nincluding  engagement of a leading threat response team,  involvement  of  other  forensic \nexperts,  and  cooperation  with  law  enforcement.  We  first  released  a  preliminary  public \nstatement  on  December  28,  2017  describing  our  initial  response  (available  at \nhttps://www.jasonsdeli.com/security), and later on January 2011, 2018 posted a Notice of \nData  Breach  capturing  findings  in  the  early  stages  of  our  investigation  (available  at \nhttps://www.jasonsdeli.com/data-breach).  \n \n \nAfter  completing  a  thorough  forensic  investigation,  we  confirm  that  criminals \ndeployed RAM-scraping malware on a number of our point-of-sales (POS) terminals at \nvarious corporate-owned Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurants (see Appendix A attached for a list of \npotentially affected restaurant locations) starting on June 8, 2017. During the course of \nour investigation, our response team contained the breach and disabled the malware in all \nof the locations where it was discovered. \n \n \nOur  forensic  findings  revealed  that  the  criminals  used  the  malware  to  obtain \npayment card information off of the POS terminals beginning on June 8, 2017 and ending \non December 29, 2017. Our investigation has determined that approximately 3.4 million \n\nLaw Offices \n\n1500 K Street, NW \nSuite 1100 \nWashington, DC \n20005-1209 \n\n202-842-8800 \n202-842-8465 fax \nwww.drinkerbiddle.com \n\nCALIFORNIA \n\nDELAWARE \n\nILLINOIS \n\nNEW JERSEY \n\nNEW YORK \n\nPENNSYLVANIA \n\nTEXAS \n\nWASHINGTON D.C. \n\n   \n\n \n\nEstablished 1849 \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\nUpdated Notice of a Security Breach \nRef.

However, unlike a situation  in  which a \nblock of static data is illegally copied and stolen all at once, the RAM-scraping malware \nemployed  by  the  criminals  against  Jason\xe2\x80\x99s  Deli  copied  data  as  individual  transactions \noccurred on the affected POS terminals over a specific period of time. Our preliminary \ncount was based on the transaction data we had available to us at the time. We recently \nobtained from our payment processor the complete set of transactions that may have been \nimpacted.  Using  that  more  complete  information,  we  have  estimated  the  number  of \npotentially exposed cards to be approximately 3.4 million.  \n \n \nThe payment card information obtained remains the same as previously reported, \ni.e. full track data from a payment card\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic stripe. Although this information varies \nfrom card issuer to card issuer, full track data can include the following: cardholder name, \ncredit  or  debit  card  number,  expiration  date,  cardholder  verification  value,  and  service \ncode. However, it should be noted that the cardholder verification value that may have been \ncompromised is not the same as the three-digit value printed on the back of certain payment \ncards (e.g., Discover, MasterCard, and Visa) or the four-digit value printed on the front of \nother payment cards (e.g., American Express). In addition, the track data does not include \npersonal identification numbers (PINs) associated with debit cards.  \n \n \nJason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli recently posted an updated consumer notification letter online through \nits website (see Appendix B attached for a copy of the consumer notice) on May 18, \n2018,  which  includes  instructions  to  obtain  information  about  the  breach  and  options \navailable \nemail \ncustomer.service@jasonsdeli.com,  and  phone  line,  409-838-1976,  Monday  through \nFriday,  8am  to  5pm  CT.

\nOn December 22, 2017, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli was notified by payment processors that credit card \n \nsecurity personnel had informed it that a large quantity of payment card information had appeared \nfor sale on the \xe2\x80\x9cdark web,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an analysis of the data indicated that at least a portion of the \ndata may have come from various Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli locations. Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli\xe2\x80\x99s management immediately \nactivated our response plan, including engagement of a leading threat response team, involvement \nof other forensic experts, and cooperation with law enforcement. We first released a preliminary \npublic statement on December 28, 2017 describing our initial response, and later on January 2011, \n2018 posted this Notice of Data Breach capturing findings in the early stages of our investigation.  \n \nAfter completing a thorough forensic investigation, we confirm that criminals deployed \nRAM-scraping malware on a number of our point-of-sales (POS) terminals at various corporate-\nowned Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurants (see below for a list) starting on June 8, 2017. During the course \nof our investigation, our response team contained the breach and disabled the malware in all of the \nlocations where it was discovered. \n \nWhat Information Was Involved? \n \nWe believe that the criminals used the malware to obtain payment card information off of \nthe POS terminals beginning on June 8, 2017 and ending on December 29, 2017. Our investigation \nhas determined that approximately 3.4 million unique payment cards were used on the impacted \nPOS terminals during this period. Specifically, the payment card information obtained was full \ntrack data from a payment card\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic stripe. While this information varies from card issuer \nto card issuer, full track data can include the following: cardholder name, credit or debit card \nnumber, expiration date, cardholder verification value, and service code. However, it should be \nnoted that the cardholder verification value that may have been compromised is not the same as \nthe security code printed on the back of certain payment cards (e.g., Discover, MasterCard, and \nVisa) or printed on the front of other payment cards (e.g., American Express). In addition, the track \ndata does not include personal identification numbers (\xe2\x80\x9cPINs\xe2\x80\x9d) associated with debit cards. \n \nWe previously reported on January 11, 2018 that approximately 2 million unique payment \n \ncards may have been exposed, and we want to explain the difference in volume between that earlier \nestimate and what we now believe to be a more accurate number. Unlike a situation in which a \n\n\x0cDeli Management, Inc. \nUpdated Notice of a Data Breach \n \nblock of static data is illegally copied and stolen all at once, the RAM-scraping malware employed \nby  the  criminals  against  Jason\xe2\x80\x99s  Deli  copied  data  as  individual  transactions  occurred  on  the \naffected POS terminals over a specific period of time. Our preliminary count was based on the \ntransaction  data  we  had  available  to  us  at  the  time.  We  recently  obtained  from  our  payment \nprocessor the complete set of transactions that may have been impacted. Using that more complete \ninformation, we now believe the number to be approximately 3.4 million cards. \n \nWhat Are We Doing? \n \nSince the breach was discovered and throughout the entire investigative process, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s \nDeli has worked closely with third-party forensics and cyber security firms, as well as federal law \nenforcement, to investigate and contain the breach. In addition, we are working to make whatever \nchanges may be necessary to strengthen our systems against attack, and are investing in advanced \nnetwork monitoring capabilities and improving our payment systems to protect the security of your \ninformation. \n \nWhat Can You Do? \n \nit is protected. There are also things you can do: \n \nFirst,  to  determine  whether  you  may  have  been  affected  by  this  security  breach,  we \nrecommend that you review the list of impacted Jason\xe2\x80\x99s Deli restaurants (see below for a list) and \nreview your credit and debit card statements for any unauthorized charges.  If you think you have \nbeen  affected,  please  contact  (i)  your  credit  or  debit  card  company  to  report  the  potential \nunauthorized activity; and (ii) contact us at customer.service@jasonsdeli.com or call 409-838-\n1976 (Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm CT), to obtain more information about the breach and \nthe options available to you at this time. \nFurthermore, we encourage our customers to remain vigilant by reviewing your credit and \n \ndebit account statements, as well as your credit report, for any unauthorized activity.

To  remove  the  freeze  or  to  provide  authorization  for  the \ntemporary release of your credit report, you must contact the consumer reporting agency \nand provide all of the following:   \n\n1.  the unique personal identification number, password or similar device provided \n\nby the consumer reporting agency;   \n\n2.  proper identification to verify your identity;  \n3.  information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report \n\nor the period of time for which the credit report may be released to users of the \ncredit report; and   \n\n4.  payment of a fee, if applicable. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a \nfreeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days \nafter receiving the request.  As of September 1, 2008, a consumer reporting agency shall \ncomply  with  the  request  within  fifteen  minutes  of  receiving  the  request  by  a  secure \nelectronic method or by telephone.   \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A security freeze does not apply in all circumstances, such as where you have an existing \naccount relationship and a copy of your credit report is requested by your existing creditor \nor  its  agents  for  certain  types  of  account  review,  collection,  fraud    control  or  similar \nactivities;  for  use  in  setting  or  adjusting  an  insurance  rate  or  claim  or  insurance \nunderwriting;  for  certain  governmental  purposes;  and  for  purposes  of  prescreening  as \ndefined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.   \nIf you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone or insurance account, you \nshould understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your \nown applications for credit.  You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either completely if \nyou are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, with enough advance notice \nbefore you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect.  You should contact a consumer \nreporting agency and request it to lift the freeze at least three business days before applying.  \nAs of September 1, 2008, if you contact a consumer reporting agency by a secure electronic \nmethod or by telephone, the consumer reporting agency should lift the freeze within fifteen \nminutes.  You have a right to bring a civil action against a consumer reporting agency that \nviolates your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\n \nFor  North  Carolina  Residents:  You  may  contact \nthe  North  Carolina  Attorney \nGeneral\xe2\x80\x99s Office at 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, or call 919-716-6400.

A  fraud alert can  make it more difficult for someone to  get credit in  your name \nbecause it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your \nability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three \nnationwide consumer reporting agencies. Contact information for each of the three credit \nreporting agencies is provided above. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then \nalso must place fraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. \nAn initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended \nalert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven years. To place either of \nthese alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of \nyour identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended \nalert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a \ncopy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and \nadditional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more \ndetailed information about the identity theft report, visit http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  You may also obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and \nensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to \nplace a security freeze on your credit report pursuant to West Virginia law. The security \nfreeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your \ncredit report without your express authorization or approval. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved \nin your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, \nwithin five business days you will be provided a unique PIN or password to use if you \nchoose  to  remove  the  freeze  on  your  credit  report  or  to  temporarily  authorize  the \ndistribution of your credit report for a period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide \nthat authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the \nfollowing: \n\n1.  The unique PIN or password provided by the consumer reporting agency; \n2.  Proper identification to verify your identity; and \n3.  The period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a \nfreeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days \nafter receiving the request. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  A security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account \nrelationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents \nor  affiliates  for  certain  types  of  account  review,  collection,  fraud  control  or  similar \nactivities. \nIf you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in \nlifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit.

IMB takes the security and privacy of the \ninformation in its control very seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring \nin the future.  \n\n1. \n\nNature of the security incident.  \n\nOn April 11, 2018, IMB discovered unusual activity in its IT network and detected an unknown criminal \nactor accessing a data file within its system. This data file included information provided by individuals \nas part of the initial application process to serve with IMB as field personnel, volunteer, or home office \nstaff.    IMB  immediately  terminated  the  unauthorized  access  and  implemented  measures  to  secure  its \nnetwork. In addition, IMB launched a thorough investigation, with the help of leading independent data \nforensics experts, to determine what information may have been accessed by the criminal actor.  IMB is \nalso coordinating with a law enforcement investigation. \n\nAs  a  result  of  this  investigation,  it  was  determined  that  the  data  file  contained  individuals\xe2\x80\x99  personal \ninformation.

I  write  to  provide  notification \nregarding an  incident  that  may  involve  the protected  health  information  and/or  personal \ninformation of  960,561  Iowa residents.    UnityPoint Health\xe2\x80\x99s  investigation is ongoing and this \nnotification will be supplemented with any new significant facts or findings subsequent to this \nsubmission, if any.  By  providing this notice,  UnityPoint Health  does not waive any rights or \ndefenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law or personal jurisdiction.  \n\nOn  May  31,  2018,  UnityPoint  Health  discovered  that  a  phishing  email  attack  had \ncompromised  its  business  email  system  which may  have  resulted in unauthorized access to\nprotected health information and other personal information for some patients. Upon learning of \nthis attack, UnityPoint Health informed law enforcement agencies and launched an investigation \nwith an expert computer forensics firm to determine the size and scope of the attack, as well as \nthe number of people potentially impacted.\n\nThe investigation shows that UnityPoint  Health received a series of fraudulent phishing \nemails which tricked some employees into providing their confidential sign-in information which \ngave attackers access to their internal email accounts between March 14, 2018 and April 3, 2018. \nWhile  unauthorized access  to  patient  information may  have  occurred,  no  known  or  attempted \nmisuse  of  patient  information  has  been  reported  at  this  time.  Electronic  medical  r ecord  and \npatient billing systems were not impacted by this attack. The only unauthorized access to patient \ninformation  may  have  occurred  through  compromised  email  accounts,  where  the  information \nwas contained in the body of an email or in attachments such as reports.\n\nPatient information that may have been in compromised email accounts included patient \nnames  and  one  or  more  of  the  following:  addresses,  dates  of  birth,  medical  record numbers, \n\n{7552606:2 }\n\n\x0cMs. Susan M.

For  some  individuals, \ninformation may have included a Social Security number and/or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license number. For a \nlimited  number  of  individuals,  information  may  also  have  included  payment  card  or  bank \naccount numbers. \n\nUnityPoint  Health  has  taken  a  number  of  important  steps  intended  to  prevent  similar \nsituations from happening in the future, including password resets for all compromised accounts \nto prevent further unauthorized access, implemented mandatory education for employees to help \nthem  recognize  and  avoid  phishing  emails,  added  technology  to  identify  suspicious  external \nemails; and implemented multi-factor authentication.\n\nUnityPoint  Health  is providing written notification via U.S. Mail commencing on July \n30,  2018 to  individuals  impacted  by  this  incident  (where  last  known  home  address  was \navailable), in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto.  UnityPoint Health will \noffer free credit monitoring services for one year to individuals whose Social Security number \nand/or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license number were included in the compromised email accounts.  UnityPoint\nHealth will  advise the  residents  to  remain  vigilant  in  reviewing  account  and  explanation  of \nbenefits statements for fraudulent or irregular activity.  UnityPoint Health will provide dedicated \ncall  center  support  to  answer  questions.    Where  applicable, UnityPoint  Health  will advise the \nresidents about the process for placing a fraud alert on their credit files, placing a security freeze, \nand obtaining a free credit report. Where applicable, the residents will also be provided with the \ncontact information for the consumer reporting agencies and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn addition, we have notified the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n\nServices Office for Civil Rights, pursuant to 45 CFR 164.408.  \n\nShould  you  have  any  questions  regarding  this  notification,  please  contact  me  at  (248) \n\n220-1356 or dpaluzzi@mcdonaldhopkins.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDominic A.

On May 31, 2018, we discovered \nthat a phishing email attack had compromised our business email system and may have resulted in unauthorized access to protected \nhealth information and other personal information for some patients. Our investigation indicates that some of your information was \ncontained in one or more of the compromised email accounts.\n\nWe take our responsibility to protect your information seriously and deeply regret this incident occurred. While we are not aware of \nany misuse of patient protected health or other personal information, we want to inform you about what happened, what information \nwas involved, what we have done to address the situation, and what you can do to help protect yourself. \n\nWhat Happened\n\nOur investigation shows that our organization received a series of fraudulent emails known as \xe2\x80\x9cphishing\xe2\x80\x9d that were disguised to \nappear to have come from a trusted executive within our organization. The phishing emails tricked some of our employees into \nproviding their confidential sign-in information which gave attackers access to their internal email accounts between March 14, 2018 \nand April 3, 2018. Some of the compromised accounts included emails or attachments to emails, such as standard reports related to \nhealthcare operations, containing protected health information and/or personal information for certain patients. While unauthorized \naccess to patient information may have occurred, no known or attempted misuse of patient information has been reported at this time. \n\nOur investigation and outside experts\xe2\x80\x99 review indicate that this series of phishing emails was part of an attack on our business email \nsystem. According to computer forensic experts and law enforcement, these types of attacks are usually financially motivated. The \nphishing attack on UnityPoint Health was more likely focused on diverting business funds from our organization, rather than on \nobtaining patient information. Based on our investigation, we believe the perpetrators were trying to use the email system to divert \npayroll or vendor payments. \n\nWe want to reassure you that our electronic medical record and patient billing systems were not impacted by this attack. The only \nunauthorized access to patient information may have occurred through compromised email accounts, where the information was \ncontained in the body of an email or in attachments such as reports. It is common and appropriate for patient information to be shared \nthrough business email between employees authorized to use it as part of their work to support patient care.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved\n\nThe compromised email account(s) that were accessed may have included your name and one or more of the following information: \naddress,  date  of  birth,  Social  Security  number,  driver\xe2\x80\x99s  license  number,  medical  record  number,  medical  information,  treatment \ninformation, surgical information, diagnosis, lab results, medication(s), provider(s), date(s) of service, insurance information, payment \ncard number and/or bank account number.\n\nV2771 v.03\n\n\x0cWhat UnityPoint Health Has Done to Address the Situation\n\nUpon learning of this attack, UnityPoint Health launched an investigation with an expert computer forensics firm to determine the \nsize and scope of the attack, as well as the number of people potentially impacted. We informed law enforcement agencies about this \nsituation. In addition, our organization has taken a number of important steps intended to prevent similar situations from happening \nin the future:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  We reset passwords for all compromised accounts to prevent further unauthorized access;\n\xe2\x80\xa2  We conducted mandatory education for our employees to help them recognize and avoid phishing emails; \n\xe2\x80\xa2  We added technology to identify suspicious external emails; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2  We implemented multi-factor authentication which requires users to go through multiple steps to verify their identity in order to \n\naccess our systems.\n\nWhat You Can Do to Protect Your Personal and Health Information\n\nWe want to help protect you from potential misuse of your personal information. We are offering you a free one-year membership for \ncredit monitoring through Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B.

A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally \nbefore they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. \nAs soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others. \n\nEquifax  \n \nP.O. Box 105069 \n \nAtlanta, GA 30348  \nwww.equifax.com  \n1-800-525-6285 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nExperian \n \nP.O.

Box 2000\nChester, PA 19016\nwww.transunion.com\n1-800-680-7289\n\n3. \n\nConsider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File\n\nYou may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from releasing any information \nfrom a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit report without the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s written authorization. However, please be advised that placing a security \nfreeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit \nmortgages, employment, housing, or other services. If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit bureau with \na valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge \nyou a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. Fees vary based on where you live, but commonly range \nfrom $3 to $15. You will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you \nwish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. In order to request a security freeze, you will need to supply your full name, address, \ndate of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to five previous years, email address, a copy of your state \nidentification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility bill, bank or insurance statement, or other statement proving residence. \nTo find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:\n\nEquifax Security Freeze \nPO Box 105788 \n \nAtlanta, GA 30348 \nhttps://www.freeze.equifax.com \n1-800-685-1111 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nExperian Security Freeze  \n \nPO Box 9554 \nAllen, TX 75013 \n \nhttp://experian.com/freeze    \n \n1-888-397-3742 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTransUnion Security Freeze\nP.O.

Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you \nreceive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that \nyou did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit \nreporting company.\n\n5. \n\nAdditional Helpful Resources\n\nEven if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends \nthat you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address \nthem quickly.\n\nIf you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law \nenforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information \nit contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at \nwww.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response \nCenter, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. Your complaint will be added to the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s Identity Theft Data \nClearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. In addition, you may obtain information from \nthe FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes.\n\nIowa Residents: You may contact law enforcement or the Iowa Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office to report suspected incidents of identity \ntheft: Office of the Attorney General of Iowa, Consumer Protection Division, Hoover State Office Building, 1305 East Walnut Street, \nDes Moines, IA 50319, www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov, Telephone: (515) 281-5164. \n\nV2774 v.03\n\n\x0c'",07-30-18,Iowa

This notice\nis to inform you that some Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen restaurants have been the victims of\ncyberattacks, which may have resulted in unauthorized access to or acquisition of your\npayment card information. Below you will find more information about the incident and the\nsteps we are taking, as well as the steps you can take, to help protect you and minimize the\nrisk of your payment card information being misused.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nOn August 16, 2018, Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen (a concept acquired by Darden Restaurants\nin 2017) learned that between November 3, 2017 and January 2, 2018, an unauthorized\nperson or persons gained access to the Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen network and were able to\naccess and potentially obtain payment card information used to make purchases in certain\nCheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen restaurants in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,\nDelaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri,\nNebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,\nTexas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nOnce Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen learned of this incident, we engaged a third-party\ncybersecurity firm to investigate. Our current systems and networks were not impacted by this\nincident. The unauthorized access appears to have occurred on a network that was\npermanently disabled and replaced by April 10, 2018. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that there are no\nindications of unauthorized access to the current Cheddar\xe2\x80\x99s Scratch Kitchen network and\nsystems.\n\nWhat Information Was Involved\n\nWhile the investigation continues, our current understanding is that the affected personal\ninformation involved payment card information, including payment card numbers.\n\nWhat We Are Doing\n\nWe take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously. As noted, this\nincident occurred on a network that was permanently disabled and replaced by April 10, 2018.\nAs an added precaution, we have arranged to have ID Experts\xc2\xae provide identity protection\nservices at no cost to those individuals who may have been affected by the incident. To enroll\nfor the services, please call (888) 258-7280 by November 22, 2018. ID Experts is offering the\nfollowing services: MyIDCare services include 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring,\n\n\x0ca $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed identity theft recovery\nservices. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is\ncompromised.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nEnroll in the identity protection services we are providing. Even if you choose not to enroll, we\nrecommend that you remain vigilant and take steps to protect yourself from identity theft by\nreviewing your account statements and by checking your credit report from one or more of the\nnational credit reporting agencies periodically. You are entitled to obtain a free annual credit\nreport from each of the nationwide credit reporting companies\xe2\x80\x94Equifax, Experian, and\nTransUnion. To do so, please go to www.annualcreditreport.com\n(http://www.annualcreditreport.com) or call 1-877-322-8228. If you notice any suspicious\nactivity, you should promptly report such activity to the proper law enforcement agencies.\n\nWe also recommend that you consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files. Adding a fraud\nalert to your credit report file makes it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name by\nrequiring creditors to follow certain procedures. However, this may also delay your ability to\nobtain credit. No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you, so if\nyou elect to do so, contact one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. The first\nagency that processes your fraud alert will notify the others to do so as well.\n\nYou may also add a security freeze to your credit report file to prohibit a credit reporting\nagency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written\nauthorization. In some cases, agencies may charge a fee to place or remove such a freeze.\n\nEquifax \nConsumer Fraud Division \nP.O.

Look for accounts or creditor\ninquiries that you did not initiate or do not recognize. Look for information, such as home\naddress and Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not\nunderstand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report and\npromptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law\nenforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, or the\nFederal Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cFTC\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nYou have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Immediately upon becoming aware of this potential theft, SHEIN hired a \nleading international forensic cybersecurity firm as well as an international law firm to conduct a \nthorough investigation.  \n \nWhile the full extent of the attack will continue to be investigated, it can now be confirmed that the \npersonal information illegally acquired by the intruders included email addresses and encrypted \npassword credentials of customers who visited the company website. It is our understanding that the \nbreach began in June 2018 and continued through early August 2018 and involves approximately 6.42 \nmillion customers. SHEIN may update this information at a later date based on any new findings. \n \nDuring the investigation, SHEIN and its IT staff, as well as its cybersecurity investigators, will continue to \nclosely monitor the network and servers so future breaches can be prevented. In addition, SHEIN servers \nhave been scanned and malware found on the servers has been removed. \xe2\x80\x9cBack door\xe2\x80\x9d entry points to \nthe servers opened by the attackers have been closed and removed.  \n \nSHEIN is in the process of notifying the proper authorities and its customers who may have been \naffected. SHEIN is sending customer notices that provide instructions for resetting passwords through \nthe website. The resetting of passwords will help ensure the security of the site and customer \npurchases. \n \nAt SHEIN, we value our customer\xe2\x80\x99s safety and security above all else, and for this reason we are offering \none year of identity theft monitoring to affected customers in certain markets. We will remain vigilant as \nwe complete the investigation and implement new safeguards to prevent any future breaches.  \n \nFor more information regarding the investigation and the actions SHEIN is taking to protect customer \ninformation, please refer to our FAQ at www.shein.com/datasecurity or contact us at 844-802-2500. \n \n\n### \n\n\x0c'",10-10-18,Iowa

Walnut Street \nDes Moines, Iowa 50319-0106 \n\nRe: \n \n\n \n\nIncident Notification \n \n\nDear Sir or Madam: \n\nWe are writing to notify you of an incident on behalf of our client, Title Nine Sports, Inc.   \n\n \n\n(\xe2\x80\x9cTitle Nine\xe2\x80\x9d).  \n\nOn August 6, 2018, Title Nine was notified by one of its third-party vendors, Social Annex, Inc. \ndba Annex Cloud (\xe2\x80\x9cAnnex Cloud\xe2\x80\x9d) that it had identified and removed unauthorized code that was inserted \ninto  Annex  Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s  systems  that  operate  its  login  application.  Annex  Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s  application  enables \nindividuals to use their user name and password from social media and other websites, like Facebook and \nGoogle, to checkout on merchants\xe2\x80\x99 websites, including www.titlenine.com. In its August 6, 2018 report, \nAnnex  Cloud  identified  four  periods  of  time  when  the  unauthorized  code  was  present  and  could  have \ncaptured information entered during the checkout process on its website. Upon learning this, Title Nine \nbegan working with its e-commerce platform provider, Kibo Software, Inc., and Annex Cloud to determine \nwhat impact the added code would have. On September 7, 2018, Title Nine mailed letters to customers who \nentered information during the checkout process during the four time periods identified by Annex Cloud to \nlet them know what occurred, including to seven (7) Iowa residents. \n\nDespite its first report that only identified four time periods, Annex Cloud informed Title Nine that \nthey  had  identified  additional  time  periods  between  December  28,  2017  and  July  9,  2018  when  the \nunauthorized code was or could have been present. If present, the unauthorized code could have captured \ninformation  entered  during  the  checkout  process,  including  name,  address,  payment  card  number, \nexpiration date, and card security code (CVV). Through October 25, 2018, Title  Nine sought additional \ninformation  from  Annex  Cloud  to  determine  the  transactions that  might  be  involved,  and  Annex  Cloud \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0cOffice of the Attorney General of Iowa \nNovember 12, 2018 \nPage 2 \n\nsupplied additional information about their analysis regarding these periods, including their belief that there \nare certain times inside these additional periods when it cannot be determined if the unauthorized code was \npresent. However, Title Nine did not exclude these times within these additional periods when identifying \nindividuals to notify. \n\nBeginning on November 12, 2018, Title Nine will provide written notifications via United States \nPostal  Service  First-Class  mail  to  1,116  Iowa  residents  who  entered  information  during  the  checkout \nprocess during the additional time periods identified by Annex Cloud. A copy of the notification letter is \nenclosed.1 Title Nine is providing notice as soon as possible in compliance with Ia. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 715C.1 \net  seq.  after  working  to  obtain  information  needed from  Annex  Cloud  to  determine  how  to  identify  the \nadditional individuals to notify.   \n\nTo  prevent  this  from  happening  again,  Title  Nine  has  removed  Annex  Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s  Social  Login \n\napplication and is continuing to take steps to strengthen the security of its website. \n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely, \n \n\n \n\nCraig A.

We are writing to inform you about an incident involving one of our third-party vendors, Annex Cloud, \nthat may involve some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and \nsome steps you can take in response.\nAnnex Cloud provides a service that enables individuals to use their user name and password from social media and \nother websites, like Facebook and Google, to login to merchants\xe2\x80\x99 websites, including www.titlenine.com. Annex \nCloud recently informed Title Nine that they had detected and removed unauthorized code that had been inserted into \nAnnex Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s systems that operate its login application. In its report, Annex Cloud identified four periods of time \nwhen the unauthorized code was present and could have captured information entered during the checkout process \non our website. We removed Annex Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s code from our website and mailed letters to those customers to let them \nknow what occurred. \nDespite its first report that only identified four time periods, Annex Cloud informed Title Nine that they had identified \nadditional time periods between December 28, 2017 and July 9, 2018 when the unauthorized code was or could have \nbeen present. If present, the unauthorized code could have captured information entered during the checkout process \non our website, including name, address, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV). \nThrough October 25, 2018, Title Nine sought additional information from Annex Cloud to determine the transactions \nthat might be involved, and Annex Cloud supplied additional information about their analysis regarding these periods, \nincluding their belief that there are certain times inside these additional periods when it cannot be determined if the \nunauthorized code was present. Thus, we are notifying you because you entered information during the checkout \nprocess during a time period when it is possible the unauthorized code may have been present.\nWe remind you to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any \nunauthorized charges. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment \ncard network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a \ntimely manner. The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card. Please see the section that \nfollows this notice for additional steps you may take.\nWe regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. To help prevent a similar incident from \noccurring  in  the  future, Title  Nine  has  removed  the Annex  Cloud  application  and  is  continuing  to  take  steps  to \nstrengthen the security of our website. \nIf you have questions, please call 888-238-0615, Monday to Friday, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Pacific Time.\nSincerely,\nJohnny Lin\nJohnny Lin \nPresident\n\nW1881 v.03 11.09.2018\n\n\x0cADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE\n\nWe recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements \nand free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, \nonce every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit \nreport, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three \nnationwide credit reporting companies is as follows: \n\nEquifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111\nExperian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742\nTransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been \nmisused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office in your \nstate. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well \nas information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities \nand file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to \ncorrect your records.

You also have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, as described below.\nFraud Alerts:  There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice \nthat you may be a victim of fraud\xe2\x80\x94an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be \nplaced on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud \nalert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if \nyou have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays \non your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three \nnational credit reporting agencies.\nCredit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free \nof charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you \nwhen you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit \nreport without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able \nto get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay \nyour ability to obtain credit. \nThere is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on \nyour credit file at each credit reporting company. \nFor  information  and  instructions  to  place  a  security  freeze,  contact  each  of  the  credit  reporting  agencies  at  the \naddresses below:\n\nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com\nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com \n\nW1882 v.03 11.09.2018\n\n\x0cIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n\n1.

The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide you with \na unique personal identification number (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal \nor lifting of the security freeze.\nTo lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a \nsecurity freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure \nelectronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or \novernight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security \nnumber) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity \nof those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the \ncredit report available.

(\xe2\x80\x9cHealthEquity\xe2\x80\x9d),  a  client  of  Bryan  Cave \nLeighton  Paisner  LLP  (our  \xe2\x80\x9cFirm\xe2\x80\x9d),  is  providing  notice  of  a  data  security  breach  to  your  office. \nHealthEquity  has  notified  or  will  soon  notify  individuals  who  reside  in  your  state  that  two  corporate \nemail  accounts were compromised  that potentially exposed  personal information. HealthEquity, either \ndirectly or in association with employers and health plans, provides services designed to give individuals \ntax  advantages  to  offset  health  care  costs,  including  health  savings  accounts  (\xe2\x80\x9cHSAs\xe2\x80\x9d),  health \nreimbursement  arrangements  (\xe2\x80\x9cHRAs\xe2\x80\x9d),  health  flexible  spending  arrangements  (\xe2\x80\x9cFSAs\xe2\x80\x9d),  limited \npurpose  FSAs  (\xe2\x80\x9cLPFSAs\xe2\x80\x9d),  and  dependent  care  reimbursement  accounts  (\xe2\x80\x9cDCRAs\xe2\x80\x9d).  HSAs  are \nindividual custodial accounts, and HRAs, FSAs, LPFSAs, and DCRAs are employer plans (see, e.g., IRS \nPublication 969). The incident also involved HealthEquity employee health plan enrollment information.  \nLetters  to  affected  individuals  were  sent  by  first  class  U.S.  mail  to  consumers  starting  on \nNovember 15, 2018, and final letters will be transmitted no later than November 27, 2018. HealthEquity \nis  providing  you  this  notice  on  behalf  of  itself  and  multiple  employers  and  health  plans  that  were \nimpacted and have been notified. Please contact me if you would like more information concerning those \nentities. \n\nAs  described  in  the  sample  notices  attached  to  this  letter,  on  October  5,  HealthEquity\xe2\x80\x99s \ninformation  security  team  identified  unauthorized  logins  to  two  HealthEquity  employees\xe2\x80\x99  email \naccounts. The team immediately implemented security measures to prevent further access to the email \naccounts  and  began  analyzing  all  information  contained  in  these  accounts  to  identify  any  sensitive \npersonal information. The unauthorized access occurred, in the case of one account, on October 5, and in \nthe case of the other, on different occasions between September 4, 2018 and October 3, 2018. Although \nwe have no evidence that the unauthorized individual viewed any of the emails in the email accounts, \nHealthEquity  cannot  conclusively  rule  out  this  possibility.  An  investigation  by  a  third-party  forensics \nfirm  determined  that  this  incident  was  limited  to  two  email  accounts  and  did  not  affect  any  other \nHealthEquity systems. \n\n\x0cAttn: Security Breach Notification \nNovember 15, 2018 \nPage 2\n\nOur Firm began providing the initial results of a forensic review of the contents of the mailbox \non October 20, 2018, to identify documents that may have contained personally identifiable information \n(\xe2\x80\x9cPII\xe2\x80\x9d).  The  review  identified  a  number  of  emails  and  attachments  that  included  certain  PII. \nHealthEquity began notifying its health plans and business partners on October 22, 2018. \n\nAs  indicated  in  the  attached  notification  letter  samples,  HealthEquity  is  providing  different \nversions of its notification letter to individuals to match the PII that may have been exposed. Example \ndraft versions of these letters are attached to this notice. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recipients of Version A had an account administered by HealthEquity and may have had their \n\nname and Social Security number exposed. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recipients of Version B had an account administrated by HealthEquity and may have had their \nname,  Social  Security  number,  account  type  (HSA,  HRA,  FSA,  LPFSA,  DCRA),  and \nemployer\xe2\x80\x99s name exposed. This version was drafted in conjunction with a health plan partner. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recipients of Version C had an account administered by HealthEquity and may have had their \nname, Social Security number, account type (HSA, HRA, FSA, LPFSA, DCRA), and associated \nemployer or plan exposed. This version was drafted in conjunction with a health plan partner. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recipients  of  Version  D  are  employees  or  former  employees  (and  their  dependents)  of \n\nHealthEquity whose health plan enrollment data may have been exposed.  \nThe following chart shows the number of individuals in your state receiving each version of the \n\nletter: \n\nVersion A \n\n 308  \n\nVersion B \n\n 7  \n\nVersion C \n\n 931  \n\nVersion D \n\n -    \n\nTotal \n 1,246  \n\nIn  addition,  law  enforcement  has  been  notified.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you \nmay  obtain  a  free  copy  of  your  credit  report  online  at  www.annualcreditreport.com  or  by  calling  toll  free \n1.877.322.8228. For more information about the FCRA, please visit https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-\n0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. You may also contact one or more of the three national consumer reporting \nagencies listed below. \n \nFraud Alerts and Security Freezes \nAt no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors to \ntake additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it \ntells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the \nagency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to \nplace  fraud  alerts  on  your  file.  Should  you  wish  to  place  a  fraud  alert,  or  should  you  have  any  questions \nregarding your credit report, please contact any one of the credit reporting agencies listed below. \n \nYou may also place a security freeze on  your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from \nreleasing  any  information  from  a  consumer\xe2\x80\x99s  credit  report  without  the  consumer\xe2\x80\x99s  written  authorization. \nHowever,  please  be  advised  that  placing  a  security  freeze  may  delay,  interfere  with,  or  prevent  the  timely \napproval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. \nYou may now freeze and unfreeze your credit file for free, and do so online, by phone, or by mail. \n \nYou will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if \nyou wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. To request a security freeze, you may need to supply your \nfull name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to five previous \nyears, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility bill, bank \nor insurance statement, or other statement proving residence. \n \nTo find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information: \n \n\nEquifax Security Freeze \n\nExperian Security Freeze \n\nP.O.

Start  a file  with  copies  of  your  credit reports, the  police reports,  any \ncorrespondence,  and copies of disputed bills. It is also helpful to keep a log of your conversations with \ncreditors, law enforcement officials, and other relevant parties. \n\n \nState Specific Information \n\nFor  Maryland  residents,  in  addition  to  the  FTC  and  credit  reporting  agencies,  you  can  obtain  more \ninformation about steps to avoid ID theft from the Attorney General who can be reached at: 200 St. Paul Place, \n16th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21202; tel. 1-888-743-0023; and www.oag.state.md.us.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you \nmay  obtain  a  free  copy  of  your  credit  report  online  at  www.annualcreditreport.com  or  by  calling  toll  free \n1.877.322.8228. For more information about the FCRA, please visit https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-\n0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. You may also contact one or more of the three national consumer reporting \nagencies listed below. \n \nFraud Alerts and Security Freezes \nAt no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud alert\xe2\x80\x9d on your file that alerts creditors to \ntake additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it \ntells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the \nagency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to \nplace  fraud  alerts  on  your  file.  Should  you  wish  to  place  a  fraud  alert,  or  should  you  have  any  questions \nregarding your credit report, please contact any one of the credit reporting agencies listed below. \n \nYou may also place a security freeze on  your credit  reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau from \nreleasing  any  information  from  a  consumer\xe2\x80\x99s  credit  report  without  the  consumer\xe2\x80\x99s  written  authorization. \nHowever,  please  be  advised  that  placing  a  security  freeze  may  delay,  interfere  with,  or  prevent  the  timely \napproval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. \nYou may now freeze and unfreeze your credit file for free, and do so online, by phone, or by mail. \n \nYou will need to place a security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if \nyou wish to place a freeze on all of your credit files. To request a security freeze, you may need to supply your \nfull name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, current address, all addresses for up to five previous \nyears, email address, a copy of your state identification card or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and a copy of a utility bill, bank \nor insurance statement, or other statement proving residence. \n \nTo find out more on how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information: \n \n\nEquifax Security Freeze \n\nExperian Security Freeze \n\nP.O.

You  should  report  instances  of  known  or  suspected  identity  theft  to  law \nenforcement,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  and  your  state  Attorney  General.  The  FTC  and  your \nState  Attorney  General can  also  provide  information  about steps  to  avoid  identity  theft.  You  have  the \nright to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a \ncrime  report  or  incident  report  with  law  enforcement  for  identity  theft,  you  will  likely  need  to  provide \nsome kind of proof that you have been a victim. This notice has not been delayed as the result of a law \nenforcement investigation. \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The  FTC  also  has  additional  information \nabout security freezes and fraud alerts. \n\nFighting \n\nAgainst \n\nIdentity \n\nTheft,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nBack \n\n\xef\x82\xb7  Keep a record of your contacts.

It is also helpful to keep a log of your conversations with \ncreditors, law enforcement officials, and other relevant parties. \n\n \nState Specific Information \nFor  Maryland  residents,  in  addition  to  the  FTC  and  credit  reporting  agencies,  you  can  obtain  more \ninformation about steps to avoid ID theft from the Attorney General who can be reached at: 200 St. Paul Place, \n16th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21202; tel. 1-888-743-0023; and www.oag.state.md.us.

We are writing to inform you of a \nrecent incident that may have involved your order and payment card information. This letter explains the incident, \nmeasures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.\nOn September 18, 2018, we received information about possible unauthorized access to the servers that run our \nwebsite. We immediately began an investigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm and identified \nthe possibility that an unauthorized user changed our website\xe2\x80\x99s checkout page to collect certain customer information \nwithout authorization. We removed the unauthorized code, took further measures to secure our servers, and reported \nthe incident to law enforcement and the payment card networks. On October 15, 2018, the investigation determined \nthe  information  collected  could  include  customers\xe2\x80\x99  order  information\xe2\x80\x94including  name,  address,  payment  card \nnumber, expiration date, and card security code (CVV2)\xe2\x80\x94for certain orders placed on our website where a credit \ncard number was entered while placing the order between August 13, 2018, and September 19, 2018. We are notifying \nyou because you placed an order during this period and your information may have been collected. <<variable data>>\nWe  encourage  you  to  closely  review  your  payment  card  statements  for  any  unauthorized  charges.  You  should \nimmediately report any such charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally \nprovide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are reported in a timely manner. The phone \nnumber to call is usually on the back of your payment card. Information on additional steps you can take can be found \non the following pages.  \nWe take the security of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 personal information very seriously. To help prevent a similar incident from \noccurring in the future we have implemented additional security measures for our website. \nIf  you  have  any  questions,  please  call  888-724-0243  Monday  through  Friday,  from  6:00  a.m.  to  6:00  p.m.  \nPacific Time.  \n\nSincerely.\n\nDanny Lee\nCEO Newegg\n\nW2171 v.02 11.13.2018\n\n\x0cADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE\n\nWe recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements \nand free credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit \nreporting company. \nFor more information, visit the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s identity theft website at www.identitytheft.gov. To place a security freeze on \nyour credit report, you can submit a request on the websites of the three major reporting agencies or send a written \nrequest to each by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below:\n\nExperian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com \nTransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com   \nEquifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com\n\nW2172 v.02 11.13.2018\n\n\x0cIn order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: \n\n1.

Annex Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s application enables individuals \nto use their user name and password from social media and other websites, like Facebook and Amazon, to \ncheckout  on  merchants\xe2\x80\x99  websites,  including  www.francescas.com.  Annex  Cloud  informed  Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s \nthat they had identified time periods between December 28, 2017 and July 9, 2018 when the unauthorized \ncode was or could have been present. If present, the unauthorized code could have captured information \nentered  during  the  checkout  process,  including  name,  address,  email  address,  Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s  account \npassword, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV). \n\nThrough November 8, 2018, Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s sought additional information from Annex Cloud and its \ne-commerce platform provider, Kibo Software, Inc., to determine what impact the added code would have \nand  the  transactions  that  might  be  involved.  Annex  Cloud  supplied  additional  information  about  their \nanalysis  regarding  these  periods,  including  their  belief  that  there  are  certain  times  inside  these  periods \nwhen it cannot be determined if the unauthorized code was present. However, Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s did not exclude \nthe times within these periods when identifying individuals to notify. \n\nBeginning on November 19, 2018, Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s will provide written notifications via United States \nPostal Service First-Class mail to 798 Iowa residents who entered information during the checkout process \nduring  the  time  periods  identified  by  Annex  Cloud.
