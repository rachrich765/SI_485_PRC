You may also contact the three major credit bureaus \\ndirectly to request a free copy of your credit report.\\nYou have the right to place a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecurity freeze\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency \\nfrom releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization.  The security freeze is designed \\nto prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent.  However, you should \\nbe aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in \\nyour credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application \\nyou make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.  Pursuant to \\nfederal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.  Should you wish to place \\na security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:\\n\\nExperian\\nPO Box 9554\\nAllen, TX 75013\\n1-888-397-3742\\n\\nhtml\\n\\nwww.experian.com/freeze/center.\\n\\nTransUnion\\nP.O.

An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit file.  Upon seeing a fraud alert display \\non a consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity before extending new \\ncredit.
